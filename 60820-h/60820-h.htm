  <h2 class='c004'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>In a life written by a friend for friends there
must of necessity be more of the intimacy of
private friendship than in a record written dispassionately
for an unknown public. The world
in general knows Frances Mary Buss as a public
worker—capable, energetic, successful. By her
friends she was loved as one of the most
womanly of women—true, and tender, and loyal.
Her work, to which all women of this generation
owe so much, must assume prominence in the
story of her life; but what is most desired is to
show her as she was to her friends.</p>

<p class='c006'>My warmest thanks are here offered to all
who have so freely and so kindly helped me in
this labour of love: first, to Miss Buss’ own
family and personal friends, and to old pupils;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>to Mrs. Bryant, D.Sc., and the members of the
staff in both schools; and, for many valuable
educational details, to Miss Emily Davies, Miss
Beale, Mrs. William Grey, Miss Shirreff, Miss
Mary Gurney, Miss Agnes J. Ward, Miss Hughes,
and Dr. and Mrs. Fitch.</p>

</div>
<p class='c014'>“Educate women, and you educate the teachers of men; if the child
is father to the man, the woman forms the man in educating the child.
The cause of female education is then, even in the most selfish sense, the
cause of mankind at large.”—<span class='sc'>C. G. Nicolay.</span></p>
<p class='c015'>Gracious speech can seldom have been more truthful
than when the Prince of Wales said, on July 18, 1879,
that few of their many public functions had afforded the
Princess and himself more gratification than the opening
of the great hall, given by the Clothworkers’ Company
to the North London Collegiate School for Girls, a
ceremony putting the final touch to the work of so
many years.</p>
<p class='c006'>It would not be easy to find a more attractive sight
than this spacious building, filled with its five hundred
happy young girls, either on “Founder’s Day,” when,
decked in the school flower, we see them in that April
mood in which</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The heart with rapture fills,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And dances with the daffodils;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>or when, on Prize-day, in the glory of summer roses,
their jubilant young voices ring out in the favourite
school-song, as, with fearless and confident eyes, they
look “Forty years on!” while their elders, looking back
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>down that long vista, think of the difference they can
remember between <i>Then</i> and <i>Now</i>.</p>
<p class='c006'>It was in this hall, on the prize-day of 1892, that
the chairman, Mr. Fearon, drew a remarkable contrast
between the present days of light for girls’ education,
and the dark days of the first Schools Inquiry Commission
of 1864, of which he had been a member.
Then, it was still possible for the Commissioners to
gravely ask if girls were capable of learning Latin and
mathematics? Now, as he pointed out, this question
might be answered by the results of this one year for
this one school—eighteen passes, with two honours, on
the University Examinations—to say nothing of the
recent success at Cambridge, where a woman took a
place <i>above</i> the Senior Wrangler.</p>

<p class='c006'>As a member of the Commission of 1864, and, later,
of the Endowed Schools Commission, Mr. Fearon was
glad to claim some part in the making of this first
public school for girls, of which he felt that “if ever
there was an institution of which they might be proud,
the success of which was calculated to stir the pulses,
excite the emulation and enthusiasm of others, and give
intense satisfaction to all who took part in it, either as
founder, well-wishers, or friends, it was the North London
Collegiate School for Girls.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Then, from the brilliant hall, with its “rose-bud
garden of girls,” the scene changed to the dark November
day—November 30, 1865, a date to keep in mind—when,
struggling through the November fog, Emily
Davies and Frances Mary Buss made their way to the
dull committee-room in Victoria Street, where the Commissioners
awaited their coming.</p>

<p class='c006'>The members of the Commission were Lord Taunton,
Lord Lyttelton, Lord Stanley, Sir Stafford Northcote,
the Dean of Chichester, the Rev. A. W. Thorold, Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>Acland, Mr. Baines, Mr. Forster, Mr. Erle, and Dr.
Storrar. To these, as Assistant-Commissioners, were
added Messrs. D. B. Fearon, H. A. Giffard, C. H.
Staunton, T. H. Green, J. L. Hammond, J. G. Fitch,
J. Bryce, and H. M. Bompas.</p>

<p class='c006'>The work of this Commission lasted from 1864 to
1869, and, later, many of the same gentlemen were
appointed on the Endowed Schools Commission, and
may be said to have carried on the same work, since
they here applied the remedy to ills previously discovered
by their researches. There are few of these
names which will not be held in lasting honour by all
thoughtful women who know how much is due for steady
help in every cause most concerning their welfare.</p>

<p class='c006'>It has, nevertheless, taken thirty years—since that
same November 30, 1865—to give women a place side
by side with men, on a Royal Commission, when, in
1894, Mrs. Bryant, D.Sc., took the seat Miss Buss was
no longer able to fill on the second Royal Commission
of Inquiry into Secondary Education. It is not difficult
to imagine the feeling of satisfaction with which Miss
Buss saw her “brilliant young fellow-worker,” as she
delighted to call her, taking this proud position.</p>

<p class='c006'>Further to mark the contrast between 1865 and 1894,
we may take a passage in a letter from Miss Buss to
Miss Davies, dated December 5, 1865, whilst still waiting
for the Commissioners’ Report, in which she says—</p>

<p class='c014'>“When will the evidence come, I wonder? I am so curious to
know what I said, and what you said too. It is very odd, but the
mist which surrounds that interview does not clear.</p>

<p class='c017'>“They were indeed kind, and more than kind, as you say. As
for Mr. Acland, he is what the ‘Home and Colonial’ consider you
to be!</p>

<p class='c017'>“I can’t get over my astonishment at their civility; and it is
such fun to be told to ‘take a chair,’ as if we were the ‘party’
whom servants are so fond of announcing.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>This is the one side. Wherever it was possible to
see “fun” Miss Buss would see it. But there was
another side too, revealed in a little remark made by
Mr. Fearon to Mrs. Bryant, when the prize-giving was
over at which he gave his reminiscences of that
November day: “We were all so much struck by their
perfect womanliness. Why, there were tears in Miss
Buss’ eyes!”</p>

<p class='c006'>And small wonder if this were so! In 1865—thirty
years ago—it was an event to cause a heart-thrill when
a woman was summoned, not to meekly receive information,
but actually to give it; not to listen, but to speak,
and before so important a body. It is quite conceivable
that as they paused on the threshold these two ladies
may have felt far more than a merely imaginative flash
of sympathy with brave women of old, who had faced
sterner tribunals to pay forfeit with life itself for the
holding of new and strange doctrines.</p>

<p class='c006'>To say that great events may hang on smallest
incidents is a mere truism, trite as true. But we cannot
doubt that a real turning point in the history of the
English people was reached in the first official recognition
of the equal share of women in the task of training
the young. From this date what was before impossible
became fact, and education takes rank as a true science.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is of special interest in our own day, when the
jarring note of antagonism between men and women is
too often struck, to look back and remember the help
given by men to the higher education of women. We
note that the two most definite starting points of the
new educational movement are to be found in the
very innermost sanctum, in the strongest stronghold of
masculine rights and privileges—the Universities and
the House of Commons.</p>

<p class='c006'>When, in 1863, the University of Cambridge opened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>its Local Examinations for girls, and when, in 1864, the
House of Commons gave authority to a Royal Commission
to extend its inquiry into the state of the education
of girls, the new era was practically inaugurated. Henceforth
women became free to do whatever they had
power to do.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nor was this the first help given by men to the
better education of girls. In 1848—the great year of
revolution—the professors of King’s College had opened
the classes which speedily developed into Queen’s
College, the forerunner of Bedford and Cheltenham
Colleges. In 1850 the Rev. David Laing, who had
been associated with the Queen’s College movement,
gave his valuable help in the expansion of Miss Buss’
first small school on similar lines into the North London
Collegiate School for Ladies. In 1865 this school
stood so high that Miss Buss was asked by the Commissioners
to give her views of education generally.
This summons was doubtless the result of the report of
the Assistant Commissioners who conducted the inquiry.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was mainly due to the efforts of Miss Davies
and Miss Bostock that girls’ schools were included in
this inquiry. These ladies sent up a widely signed
memorial from persons who had been interested in the
extension to girls of the Local Examinations. Mr.
Roby, the secretary, early in 1865, responded favourably
to this appeal, pointing out that, as so many girls were
privately educated, the limits of investigation in their
case were much narrower than those for boys, and also
pointing out that the numbers and value of endowments
for girls were also restricted. But, “subject to these
limitations,” he added, “the Commissioners were willing
to embrace in their inquiry the education of both sexes
alike.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He stated also that the Commissioners expected to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>derive much important information from the evidence
of persons of special experience and knowledge in the
various matters connected with their inquiry. Among
these witnesses they were ready to include <i>such persons
as may be recommended to them as best qualified to express
opinions on the subject of this memorial</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>In November, 1865, Miss Davies and Miss Buss were
called to give their evidence. Miss Beale followed in
April, 1866, and, during that same year, information
on the education and the employment of women was
given by six other ladies—Miss Wolstenholme, Miss
Porter, Miss Kyberd, Miss Martin, Miss Smith, and
Miss Gertrude King.</p>

<p class='c006'>In 1870 a valuable summary of this evidence was
compiled by Miss Beale from the twenty large volumes
issued by the Commissioners. It is from this smaller
blue-book that the following extracts are taken, the
evidence of Miss Davies, Miss Buss, and Miss Beale
being selected as characteristic of the views of the whole.</p>

<p class='c006'>Read in the light of the recent University honours
gained by women, many of the questions and answers
of these examinations will have a curious interest for
the “modern girl.”</p>

<p class='c006'>When Lord Taunton put the question to Miss
Buss:—</p>

<p class='c014'>“‘Your girls come up to you extremely ignorant,’ there is
evident conviction in her brief reply: ‘Extremely ignorant!’</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Do they seem to be very little taught at all?’—‘In all the
essentials, hardly ever. They seldom know any arithmetic, for
instance. We have a large number of girls, of thirteen, fourteen,
and fifteen, come to us who can scarcely do the simplest sum in
arithmetic.’</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Have you taken any interest in the movement which has been
made to induce the University of Cambridge to institute examinations
and confer honorary distinctions on girls?’—‘Yes; twenty-five
of our pupils went up to the experimental examination.’</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>“‘Do you anticipate any beneficial results from the steps which
the University of Cambridge has been induced to adopt?’—‘Yes;
I am quite sure that great good has been done already. An
immense stimulus has been given, especially to English and arithmetic.
The girls have something to work for, some hope, something
to aim at, and the teachers also.’</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘As far as you are able to judge, do you think the class of
school-mistresses is as good as it ought to be?’—‘The class of
teachers generally is not.’</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘In your opinion, should the education of a girl differ essentially
from that of a boy in the same rank of life, with regard to
the subjects which are to be taught?’—‘I think not, but it is rather
difficult to ascertain what is the proper education for a boy.’</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘You believe there is not such a distinction between the mental
powers of the two classes as to require any wide distinction between
the good education given to a girl and that to a boy?’—‘I am sure
girls can learn anything they are taught in an interesting manner,
and for which they have a motive to work.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Beale, when asked her opinion as to the
admission of girls to University degrees, replied in a
slightly modified strain—</p>

<p class='c014'>“‘It seems to me that our opinions are so divided at present
as to the modifications that will be introduced into girls’ education,
that I should regret to see anything done hastily to assimilate it
to that which may perhaps be altered for boys; but at the same
time I think it is good for boys and girls to have similar tastes
that their minds may not be entirely bent in different ways, so
that in their after life they should understand and be interested in
the same things.’</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘In using the word “similar,” do you mean identical?’—‘I have
had some boys as pupils in mathematics, and, as far as I can
judge from these and the public schools they attended, I do not
think that the mathematical powers of women enable them generally
(their physical strength I dare say has a great deal to do
with it) to go so far in the higher mathematics as boys; and I
think we should be straining the mind (which is of all things to
be deprecated) if we were to try to force them to take up several
examinations as are necessarily passed by those who are taking
the higher branches at the Universities.’</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘I therefore probably should not be wrong in inferring that,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>while you recognize the similarity of the male and female mind,
you would not go the length of saying that they must necessarily
move in the same channel?’—‘No, I should be sorry to see them
take up classics at all exclusively, because I do not think that,
as regards the education of boys, it has been the most desirable
to limit it thus. That is my individual opinion.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Miss Davies, after her two years’ experience as
Hon. Sec. of the Cambridge Local Examinations, had
no hesitation concerning identity of standard for boys
and for girls, when Lord Lyttelton put the case to
her—</p>

<p class='c014'>“You have taken a very active part in persuading the two
Universities to listen to facts which you had to lay before them in
reference to the state of female education. Will you be so good
as to tell us what difficulties you have encountered, and what
objection you have met with on behalf of either gentlemen or
ladies, and then make any remarks which you have to make upon
these difficulties?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Objections and difficulties equally disappear in Miss
Davies’ concise answer—</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is difficult to state objections fairly when one does not
agree with them. I think it was chiefly a sort of general feeling
that it was not in accordance with the fitness of things. The
objections seem generally to resolve themselves into that.”</p>

<p class='c005'>To the proposition of some special scheme of examination
which might be adopted for the special
requirements of women, she said simply—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I do not see what advantage it would have. It would be
difficult to frame a curriculum specially suited to girls, because
almost everybody has a separate theory about what it is good
for girls to learn—about what is apposite to the female mind.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The three ladies were agreed in accepting generally
the verdict of the Commissioners on the existing state
of girls’ schools, afterwards thus briefly summed up—</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>“It cannot be denied that our picture of middle-class education
is, on the whole, unfavourable. The general deficiency in
girls’ education is stated with the utmost confidence, and with
entire agreement, with whatever difference of statement, by many
witnesses of competent authority. Want of thoroughness and
foundation; slovenliness and showy superficiality; inattention to
rudiments; undue time given to accomplishments, and these not
taught intelligently or in any scientific manner; want of organization;—these
may sufficiently indicate the character of the
complaints received.”</p>

<p class='c005'>There is also complete agreement as regards not
only the need of better schools, but of better systems
of training for teachers. Although thankful to accept
concessions on the existing lines of boys’ education,
<i>faute de mieux</i>, they are by no means persuaded that
this education is even for boys all that could be desired.
Even at that date they could venture to intimate the
opinion that the mere fact of a University course did
not, <i>per se</i>, make a good teacher.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Davies called special attention to the fact, that
while no endowments were applied to girls above the
Elementary schools, many of these must have been
intended for girls as well as boys, since they form part
of bequests made “<i>to the children</i>” of certain parishes
or districts.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Fitch has pointed out<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c018'><sup>[1]</sup></a> that at this period, whilst
1192 boys were receiving at Christ’s Hospital an education
fitting them for the Universities, there were eighteen
girls only, and these trained as domestic servants.
Elsewhere he goes into the question, showing that while
charity schools were open to girls, they were entirely
excluded from the grammar schools, where boys were
being trained “to serve God and the State.” There is
scarcely a record, he says, of any school whose founder
deliberately intended a liberal education for girls.</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f1'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Woman and the Universities,” <i>Contemporary Review</i>, August, 1890.</p>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>“A girl was not expected ‘to serve God or State,’ and was,
therefore, not invited to the University or grammar school; but
she might, if poor, be needed to contribute to the comfort of her
‘betters’ as an apprentice or a servant, and therefore the charity
schools were open to her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And Dr. Fitch’s own experience confirms this fact.
Mr. George Moore, wishing to devote £10,000 to scholarships,
sent in a scheme for the consideration of some of
the leading educationalists, when, finding mention only
of boys, Dr. Fitch ventured to suggest the fact that
boys have sisters, receiving the explanation from Mr.
Moore that it was from no intention of excluding them
that they had been omitted, but simply that it had
never occurred to him to think of girls in such a
connection.</p>

<p class='c006'>With the Endowed Schools Commission this state
of things came to an end. We cannot tell how far the
influence of the evidence given by women to the Schools
Inquiry Commission may have extended, but it was
then decided that “in any enactment or constitution
that may be brought into operation on this question
the full participation of girls in endowments should be
broadly laid down.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Among Miss Buss’ most able supporters in obtaining
the endowment for her new schools she counted five
members of the Schools Inquiry Commission—Lord
Lyttelton, the Rev. A. W. Thorold (Bishop of Rochester
and of Winchester), Dr. Storrar, Mr. Fearon, and Mr.
Fitch. In 1866, while the Commission were still at
work, Miss Davies thus speaks of it in her “Higher
Education of Women”—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Specific schemes adapted to circumstances will be devised as
occasions arise. In the meantime, any kind of recognition of the
fact that the education of women is a matter worth thinking about
is of the utmost practical value. In this point of view, as indicating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>and expressing a growing sense of the importance of the subject,
the extension to girls of the Local Examinations of the Universities
of Cambridge and Edinburgh, and the steps taken by the Schools
Inquiry Commission in their pending investigations, have an
indirect inference quite out of proportion to the immediate and
calculable results obtained, affording a moral support and encouragement
the effect of which it is not easy to estimate.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The direct influence of the Commission may be
gauged by the fact that within ten years of this date
Miss Buss was able to make a list of forty-five new
endowed schools for girls, to contain severally from
fifty to four hundred pupils, with salaries for the head-mistresses
varying from £100 a year to £200 (exclusive
of capitation fees). Of this list she remarks—</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is not complete, but will be useful in establishing my
point, viz. that there are some good positions for properly qualified
women-teachers.</p>

<p class='c017'>“St. Paul’s is the greatest prize in the profession, or rather
would be if the scheme had become law. Do you see, the salary
might be £2000 a year. <i>Ours</i> is second, with a hundred more
pupils, and therefore more work and less pay than St. Paul’s. My
object in drawing up the list was to show the importance of training
and high education for women-teachers. Such prizes are not to
be had elsewhere. Look at Scotch girls’ schools, at German
also. We women owe a deep debt to the Endowed School
Commission.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The verdict given as the result of the Schools
Inquiry Commission does not, of course, exclude the
fact that there were then, and had always been, <i>some</i>
good private schools where a good education had been
given. The true teacher, like the poet, “is born and
not made,” the power to teach being as much a Divine
gift as that of song or of painting. It is true that the
perception of every gift must depend on its full culture,
the extent of success being determined by the amount
of genius; but there have always been born teachers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>some self-educated and some developed by exceptional
home surroundings. Women of this kind have always
existed as the loved and honoured centres of exceptional
influence, sending out pupils formed on their own
model.</p>

<p class='c006'>Doubtless, there could have been found, at any period
in the world’s history, a sufficient justification for the
attitude condemned in one of the early papers in
<i>Fraser</i> on the then quite new Queen’s College:—</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Educate the women!’ exclaimed an accomplished and excellent
man in our hearing, and with marked surprise.  ‘Where is
the necessity? A college for ladies! Nonsense! Women are
admirably educated! I see none but well-educated women around
me!’ in the tone of a man who, when told of those who hunger
for bread, should reply, ‘Want bread? Nonsense! Hunger!
There is no such thing! I see a good dinner before me every
day.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>But, granting that there was education, and of a real
kind, we must agree that this, as a rule, was accessible
only in the form of a very highly paid private governess,
or in select and very expensive private schools.
That even so much was not common, and not to be
secured by the very highest payments, may be inferred
from the account given by Miss Cobbe, in her “Autobiography,”
of a typical fashionable school, where a
two years’ course cost £1000, of which she says that
“if the object had been to produce the minimum of
result at the maximum of cost, nothing could have
been better designed for the purpose.” In this school,
she adds, “everything was taught in the inverse ratio
of its true importance. At the bottom of the scale
were morals and religion, and at the top music and
dancing.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The point to be kept before us, in considering the
special work of this past half-century, is that for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>middle-classes, including professional persons of moderate
means, good education was practically out of reach, the
cheaper schools which were open to them being, for
the most part, of the order condemned by the Commissioners.
It follows, therefore, that the opening of
the new schools—with the best teaching on moderate
terms—was a change of which the importance can
scarcely yet be justly estimated, especially when, side
by side with this preparatory movement, the advantages
of University training were added. Before this time no
girls’ schools, however advanced, had gone beyond the
subjects considered suitable for women, and any women
with knowledge of classics or mathematics were either
exceptionally gifted, or had accidentally been taught
with their brothers.</p>

<p class='c006'>When we go back to November 30, 1865, the fog
outside that committee-room is a true symbol of the
gloom that prevailed regarding the higher education of
women. Darkness still held rule, even though a few of
the topmost peaks had already caught the first rays
of the coming dawn.</p>

<p class='c006'>At that date the future was still so veiled that it
could by no possibility have occurred to Miss Davies
or Miss Buss, standing there before the Commissioners,
even to dream of themselves as what we now know
them to have been—the representatives, one of University
Education for Women, and the other of Public
Schools for Girls, that is to say, of the two most powerful
agencies in the greatest revolution of modern times.</p>

<p class='c006'>But in those days Miss Buss’ school was still her
own private property, and, as yet, no glimpse had crossed
her mental vision of its future as the model of the great
public girls’ schools now spread throughout the land.
So, too, with Miss Davies. Girton was not, and even
Hitchin had not come into view, though possibly some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>vague ideal of a true college for women may have been
taking shape in Miss Davies’ mind. But if so, it must
still have been as baseless as the poet’s dream, for no
“sweet girl-graduate” existed as yet out of the domain
of the “Princess Ida.” On this lower earth at that
time, and for many a day after, she could serve only as
matter for a flying jest.</p>

<p class='c006'>There were indeed three “Colleges” for girls—Queen’s,
Bedford, and Cheltenham, as well as the North
London Collegiate School for Ladies—all in full work,
and even then ready for the rapid expansion which
followed the opening of the Universities to women. But,
at that date, these could not rank as more than collegiate
schools; nor was more desired, for Professor Maurice is
very careful, in his inaugural address, to deprecate all
intention of emulating the poet’s creation, thus guarding
himself:—</p>

<p class='c014'>“We should indeed rejoice to profit in this or any undertaking
by the deep wisdom which the author of the ‘Princess’ has concealed
under a veil of exquisite grace and lightness; we should
not wish to think less nobly than his royal heroine does of the
rights and powers of her sex, but we should be more inclined to
acquiesce in the conclusions of her matured experience, than to
revive—upon a miserably feeble and reduced scale, with some fatal
deviations from its original statutes—her splendid but transitory
foundation.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Only the first step to the great changes of the
present day had then been taken, when, in 1863, the
University of Cambridge had allowed girls, <i>as an experiment</i>,
to join the Local Examinations. Miss Buss
always dated the later superiority of the teaching in her
school to her experiences on that occasion. Out of
eighty-four girls who went in, she sent twenty-five, of
whom fifteen passed. The failure of ten in arithmetic
pulled her up short, with the result that the teaching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>was so far changed that none failed in the next year,
when girls were finally admitted on the same terms with
boys, and the London Centre was formed under Miss
Davies. But, even in 1866, success was so far limited,
that Miss Beale could reply as follows to Lord
Lyttelton’s query, “If she had heard of these new
examinations?”—</p>

<p class='c014'>“There seems to be some difficulty in applying them to the
higher middle classes. I think of our own case. The brothers of
our pupils go to the Universities. Now, generally speaking, those
who go in for the Local Examinations occupy a much lower place
in the social scale, and our pupils would not like to be classed
with them, but regarded as equal in rank to those who pass at the
University. These feelings are stronger in small places.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The far-reaching effect of these examinations is indicated
by Miss Buss’ opinion that “until the Local
Cambridge Examinations were organized, there was no
sort of recognition on the part of men that the feminine
mind could under any circumstances rank with the
masculine.”</p>

<p class='c006'>We see from this fact that, before the middle of this
century, the “woman’s movement” could not be said
to exist at all. The question of equality—so much to
the front at present—could not then even have been
formulated. It is not till 1869 that we find it taken at
all seriously, in a paper in the <i>Macmillan</i> for March of
that year, by a writer who remarks that—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Two alternatives are open to the would-be reformers of woman.
The first of these is the line of Miss Lydia Becker, the second of
Miss Emily Davies.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And he adds that—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Without wishing to disparage unduly the efforts of any
earnest woman for what she believes to be the improvement of her
sex, a thoughtful man must feel that the second is of the two the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>wiser course; the one which is most practical, most sensible, least
dangerous, and most likely to secure the sympathy of the mass of
Englishmen and Englishwomen.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It is true that, in 1864, Dr. W. B. Hodgson, one of
the first and best friends to the higher education of
women, recognizes the fact that there might “rise up
before the affrighted fancy” visions of what are derisively
called “strong-minded women,” disputations,
brow-beating, troubled with “a determination of words to
the mouth,” loud and harsh in voice, arrogant in temper,
dogmatic, self-willed, unconventional, undomestic, impatient
of the matrimonial yoke as a badge of slavery,
and with, perhaps, a leaning to waistcoats, and collars
turned down, cigars, and hair parted on the side—such,
in short, as a recent Italian dramatist, Castelvecchio, has
so amusingly delineated in his “Donna Romantica.”
But of this type, Dr. Hodgson adds—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I know not whether the experience of my hearers is like
mine; but assuredly of the very few women in whom it has been my
lot to meet with any resemblance to this offensive type, not one
has been distinguished by superior breadth or depth of culture.
Very much the reverse. They have been remarkable for nothing
more than the want of a truly liberal education, of which it is the
high office to impart a large sympathy, a tolerant appreciation of
various opinions, respect for others, and a modest distrust of self.
It is not assuredly among the Mrs. Jamesons, the Mrs. Somervilles,
the Mrs. Brownings, the Miss Swanwicks, that such
portents are found. Dogmatism and presumption ever attend
ignorance, not knowledge; shallowness, not depth.”<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c018'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f2'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“The Education of Girls,” etc., by W. B. Hodgson, LL.D.</p>
</div>

<p class='c006'>There were, indeed, indications of the two distinct
lines of action in the work for higher education, and in
the work for political reforms. But as yet they were
not distinctly divided. The sympathies of the most
thoughtful women went out in both directions, even
whilst they might follow the one or the other more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>definitely. It was no more possible then than it would
be possible now to draw a hard and fast line; placing
on the one side the Educationalists, and on the other
the workers for Suffrage and other reforms affecting
women. Then, as now, women could be divided into
two classes only—the wise and the foolish. Then, as
now, the wise worked wisely in whatever line they
followed, while the foolish worked also after their
own kind.</p>

<p class='c006'>The educational reform attracted the larger following,
content to work in preparing women for the best
use of extended power when the time of possession
might arrive. In the mean time, the object sought was
merely the preparation for actual duties, either in home-life,
or in employments rendered necessary by the
pressure of circumstances.</p>

<p class='c006'>In looking back over the great educational movement,
which has so changed the aspect of society, two
points stand out most sharply: (1) that the work was
done in the true natural order by men and women side
by side; and (2) that it was done in the true spiritual
order, in that <i>quietness</i> which is the appointed avenue
to higher inspiration, that <i>stillness</i> which leads to vital
knowledge; and also that it was done in the <i>obedience</i>
which is the link that binds man to God—practical
religion.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is impossible to judge as yet what may be the
final outcome of the intellectual freedom now opened
to all women. There are signs of what was the most
probable immediate effect—the exaggeration of recoil
from all ancient bonds, including those of religion and
duty. Whilst it would be very short-sighted to suppose
that such a state of things could ever be permanent,
so long as women retain any remnant of the intuitional
quality which is their special dower, it may still be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>seasonable to call special attention to the fact that the
pioneers in the educational movement are, without
exception, deeply religious women. This circumstance
may or may not be an accident of no particular moment.
The point is that it is historic fact, and as such has its
own significance. In a quite special degree, we may
point to Miss Davies and to Miss Beale, as well as to
Miss Buss and Miss Clough, as quite typically <i>law-abiding</i>
and <i>obedient</i> women.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Quietness</i>, in its most literal sense, is most curiously
characteristic of all the educational leaders. The very
thought of Emily Davies, reticent and self-controlled,
gives a sense of calm and stillness. For long years we
see Frances Mary Buss curbing her magnificent energies
to the “daily round, the common task.” Anne Clough
works in silence for a lifetime, between the first little
day school in Liverpool and the success of Newnham.
Dorothea Beale, though she can rise to all poetic
heights, is observant of all the small sweet courtesies
of lowly service, and, if “learned” in all school-lore, is
also notably “learned in all gracious household ways.”
And the same must be said of Frances Martin, who, in
her College for Working Women, has so extended
the range of the new education that none now need be
left out.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nor are these qualities less conspicuous in the group
of what may be termed the “amateurs” of the movement—true
“lovers” of their kind, who, having all that
heart could desire of this world’s good, have made it
their business to share it with those less favoured:
Lady Stanley of Alderley, Lady Augusta Stanley,
Lady Frederick Cavendish, Mrs. Manning and her
daughter Miss E. A. Manning, Mrs. Reed, Miss Bostock,
Mrs. Wedgwood, Madame Bodichon, Miss Ewart,
and Miss L. M. Hubbard, all more lavish of time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>and thought and wealth than of words. And then all
the active workers: sweet Mrs. Grey, with the touch of
old-world stateliness adding strength to her sweetness;
Miss Shirreff and Miss Mary Gurney, of few words, but
these straight to the point; Mrs. Burbury, true to her
University traditions, and Mrs. Garrett-Anderson, with
the professional reticence learned in her fight through
the medical schools; Miss Davenport-Hill, known to the
School Board as the woman who can hold her tongue,
and her sister Florence, “wisest of wise women,” as her
friends call her, also with a great gift of silence; Miss
Laura Soames, too early taken from us; and the many
more like-minded, whose works rather than their tongues
still speak for them.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is not, indeed, that any one of these lacks the
power to speak, for on some occasion most have been
known to speak even from the platform, and to speak
well. But not to women like these could those famous
words of Mrs. Browning’s ever be held appropriate—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A woman cannot do the thing she ought,—</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Which means whatever perfect thing she can,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>In life, in art, in science,—but she fears</div>
      <div class='line in1'>To let the perfect action take her part,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And rest there: she must prove what she can do</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Before she does it, prate of woman’s rights,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Of woman’s mission, woman’s function, till</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The men (who are prating too on their side) cry,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>‘A woman’s function plainly is—to talk!’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>And these quiet women are the true pioneers—the
women who have actually done the work. They did
not call on the world to listen to what women might,
could, would, or should do under quite different conditions;
they simply did—under the actually existing
conditions—just the thing that needed to be done, then
and there.</p>

<p class='c006'>There was not in those days the need of perpetual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>discussions about “rights” or “wrongs.” The easiest
way to cure the wrong seemed to lie in doing the nearest
right. It was not that they were indifferent either to
existing abuses, or to past wrongs, or blind to the need
of necessary reforms. There was not one of them who
was not stirred to the depths of her being by the wrong
of past ages, or by the present anguish under which
women agonize. It was because these deepest depths
were so stirred that there they found themselves at one
with the Divine love, which has not only suffered, but has
conquered suffering—in this love finding strength for
work and patience for waiting; and, as they worked and
as they waited, there came forgiveness for the past,
healing for the present, and hope for the future. All
work that is done in the spirit of Christ is thereby lifted
above anger, bitterness, or despair. In these moods no
great or lasting work has been done or can be done.
Not for selfish ends, not even for self-development, do
the greatest workers leave the quiet of home, but only
and always for freedom to do the highest duty, for the
glorious liberty of love. Therefore the secret is not in
revolt, but in obedience to the higher law which may
indeed at times seem to be a breaking of the laws of
men. By this test we may measure all our greatest
women leaders. In turn we may find that each has
defied to the uttermost the public opinion of her time
in daring to prove her right to free action. But just in
proportion to the height to which she rose we find her
true womanliness strong to withstand any strain. The
only real stepping out of woman’s proper sphere is when
she descends to measure her strength with man on the
lower level of self-love and self-seeking.</p>

<p class='c006'>But weary as we grow of the present phase of empty
“sound and fury, signifying nothing”—the language of
revolt and invective—we need not fear for the future,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>or doubt that a true progress is taking us through all
this jarring and wrangling and strife to a safe goal—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>“Where beyond these voices there is peace.”</div>

<p class='c015'>The record of the life of Frances Mary Buss includes
within it, in brief, the story of the modern educational
movement, in which she took so leading a part. It is
not the less a story of perfect womanliness, in a career
that is one of natural and steady growth, from seed to
full fruitage. The woman simply fulfils the promise of
the child.</p>
<p class='c006'>It is a life most remarkable in this completeness.
To very few of the greatest even is it given to see their
life-work crowned with complete success. Frances
Mary Buss was one of the few who begin life with a
fixed aim, and who live to see self-devotion end in
triumph. And the end left her, as the beginning had
found her, as humble as she was loving.</p>

<p class='c006'>In an age of incessant movement it is very restful
to find a life of constant action which is yet so quiet
and orderly, with continuity of place as marked as its
continuity of purpose. All her work, widely as its
influence extended beyond these limits, was carried on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>within the parish of St. Pancras—fifty years of ceaseless
energy, from eighteen years of age to sixty-eight.</p>

<p class='c006'>In holiday-time she used her freedom for as much
change as could be compressed within holiday limits,
thus seeing much of Europe as well as of her native
land. But, excepting for one term of absence from
illness, she might always, in working time, have been
found at her post.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not for her name only, but because of her love and
good works do I love to connect her with St. Francis!”
writes an old pupil;<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c018'><sup>[3]</sup></a> and though at the first shock there
may seem a touch of incongruity in thus linking the
great ascetic saint of the past and this essentially
modern worker, there is, nevertheless, much suggestiveness
in the association.</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f3'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r3'>3</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In a bright little sketch in the <i>Woman’s Penny Paper</i>, of June 8,
1889.</p>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Are they not, after all, of the very same order?
What is the greatest saint but that child of God who
is most aware of his Divine sonship, and therefore most
intent on doing his “Father’s business”? Fashions of
service may change, but this fact remains changeless.
The fashion of the past was to mortify the flesh, and to
serve the world by prayer rather than by work. The
fashion of the present sees that “laborare est orare,”
and serves the world by self-devotion instead of self-denial.
The past was ruled by negations, and the stern
“Thou shalt not!” rose as a barrier between man and
man. The “saint” was not merely, as the word signifies,
one “set apart” to do the will of God “on earth as it
is [done] in heaven,” but he became instead one <i>cut off</i>,
or <i>separated</i>, from the life of ordinary humanity. In
our day we have risen to the power of the <i>affirmation</i>,
“Thou <i>shalt</i> love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,
and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind,” and we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>go on to the inevitable sequence, “Thou shalt love thy
neighbour as thyself.” Not the denial or the evasion
of human duties, but their fulfilment utterly, is our test
of sainthood in the present. It may be less easy to
trace our saints by the quiet fireside or in the busy
street; in the senate house or on the market-place; but
none the less saintly are these in their modern garb
than those who went their way apart, as stately abbot
or humble anchorite, as hooded friar or cloistered nun.</p>

<p class='c006'>The form may change, but the fact is the same.
With the fact of a great love filling his soul, St. Francis,
vowed to poverty, is still richer than the richest; and
our modern saint, with all life’s gifts consecrated to
service, may safely make the most of life, having thus
the more to share. Having love, riches and poverty
alike fall into their true place, as accidents, and not
essentials of being.</p>

<p class='c006'>We go back to far Assisi, and, looking across the
Umbrian plain, see the quaint quiet little hill-town—unchanged
in seven centuries—still looking like a white
dove fluttering down the dark slope of Monte Subiaco.
Here we find the boy Francis, gay and careless, dreaming
his boyish dreams of royal courts and of knightly
fame; till, falling as a dark shadow across the glittering
pageant, comes the vision of the world’s poverty and
pain, and the dreamer wakes to take his chosen place
among the poor and sorrowing. To spend and be spent
for love’s sake is henceforth the aim and the achievement
of this perfect life.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then we turn to commonplace St. Pancras, within
sound of the crowding, hurrying, tumultuous life of the
great modern city. Here we find the girl, Frances,
dreaming over her books, with who can tell what
ambitious dreams of her own future, as her heart burns
with the sense of conscious power? But to her, too,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>comes the vision of struggle and of hard toil, and to her
ear the cry of pain. And she awakes from her dream,
to spend and be spent, that in the future every woman
may rise to her full stature, set free for ever from the
trammels of ignorance and of fear.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is the very same story, only read in the light of a
different age. The key-note to these harmonious lives
is the same—love. Love, simplicity, humility, poverty
of self, and devotion to others, form the common chord
of this heavenly music, vary the movements as we may.</p>

<p class='c006'>With merely technical or dogmatic theology neither
the mediæval nor the modern saint has much to do.
Religion forms an integral part of daily life. Love to
God—accepted in His appointed channels, and for His
appointed ends—is the sum and substance of this creed.
The life of our modern worker had its roots deep down
in the love and life eternal, as is seen by its fruits. One
who knew her best—her eldest brother—says of her,
“All through her life she acted on the highest principle—as
a loving Christian. Out of this came, as the natural
fruit, her large-hearted charity, her help she gave ever
willingly to all who needed assistance.” This love
interpenetrated all her being and expressed itself in
service, in deeds, not words. “Don’t preach, but <i>be</i>;
your actions will do more than your words!” she was
wont to say to her pupils.</p>

<p class='c006'>It must all come back again to the key-note—love.
And we notice as the special quality of the modern, as
opposed to the mediæval saint, a certain <i>humanness</i>
which stoops to the smallest things, and, so stooping,
lifts them to highest uses. We read of one of the
typical saints of the olden days how she pressed into
the seclusion of her convent, stepping over the prostrate
body of her old father, whose prayers had failed to
move her. “Heaven is the price,” she would have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>said, in the favourite words of another such saint of our
own century, the Mère Angélique, who, lying pillowless
on the bare ground, spent her last dying breath in
sending from her the one human creature for whom
she had a human love, a young novice, who obeyed
her, broken-hearted. The inevitable outcome of the
ascetic ideal—of pain for pain’s sake—has always been
and must be <i>inhumanity</i>. The distinctive outcome of
the wider grasp of God’s love which in our day says
instead, pain for love’s sake only, is the exact opposite—an
ever deepening <i>humanity</i>, in which human love is
lifted up into the Divine, gathering into its embrace not
only every race of mankind, but the brute creation too.</p>

<p class='c006'>That this was characteristic in a most remarkable
degree of her whom we are glad to recognize as one
of our foremost teachers, remarkable especially in her
power of loving and of inspiring love, we see most
clearly in the word which seems by common consent
to be that chosen to describe her—<i>motherly</i>, the most
human as it is the most Divine word of mortal speech.</p>

<p class='c006'>Few things are more delightful than the effort to
trace the process by which a great personality is fitted
for a great work. We may rejoice that we possess
sufficient indications of her childhood to show how this
child grew up to make life different for the children of
after times.</p>

<p class='c006'>Frances Mary Buss, born August 16, 1827, was the
eldest child—and only daughter who survived infancy—of
parents who were both persons of exceptional force
of character. Her father was not only an artist of skill
far beyond the average, but was a man of cultivated
literary and scientific tastes. His influence was a
powerful factor in the training of the child who was
his joy and pride in her public career, as well as the
most obedient and devoted of daughters.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>The mother, almost adored by her children, was
one of those strong loving souls whose silent lives are
eloquent beyond all speech, who are enshrined in the
hearts of all within their sphere as very ideals of love
and loyalty.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Septimus Buss thus writes of—</p>
<p class='c023'>“the large-hearted loving Mother, whose motherliness was not
only for her <i>own</i>, but for all children. It was a family joke that
she came home from her walks penniless, as she could never see
a poor child looking longingly into a cake-shop without sending it
happily away in possession of a ‘goody.’ Many of us remember
how we naturally went to her for comfort, and always felt the
trouble lightened by some brave or kind word, or personal help,
if possible. What merry, cheerful, little impromptu parties there
were in her ever hospitable house, among her own children and
others who, having finished their work, remained to play!</p>
<p class='c017'>“Her watchword, like Miss Buss’, was <i>Duty</i>. I once answered,
in real fright, ‘Oh, aunt, I am sure I cannot!’ She replied,
‘Child, never say I cannot, when called to any duty, but do the
best you can!’ The devoted love that her children bore her was
only the due return for her unwearied care of, and tenderness to,
them in every detail of their life.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Her family regard it only as traditional that their
mother was descended from Mrs. Fleetwood, the
daughter of Oliver Cromwell; but I had it as an accepted
fact from one of the undoubted members of that
family, who was proud to claim even so remote a connection
with one whom she had so much admired.
Miss Andrews must have been educated at Mrs.
Wyand’s school, in the generation preceding Miss Buss,
and she probably spoke with authority on the matter.
She also had remarkable power as a teacher, with quite
original views on education, a fact interesting as throwing
a sidelight on the school in which Miss Buss was
educated, the best in the neighbourhood of Mornington
Crescent.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>In a book of “Memories,” compiled for the family
circle of Dr. Henry Buss—the “Uncle Henry” to whom,
as a girl, “Fanny” owed some of her first holiday trips
abroad—we find it recorded that “in 1689, William and
Mary brought in their train from Holland a Mrs. Buss,
who held the post of nurse to the Princess Anne,
afterwards queen.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The descendants of Mrs. Buss settled chiefly in the
county of Kent. At Bromley, in 1775, we find one of
them, Robert Buss, holding a post in the Excise. He
afterwards became a schoolmaster at Tunbridge. His
son, William Church Buss, became known as “a skilled
engraver,” and, marrying “pretty Mary Anne Starling,”
made his home, in 1803, in Jewin Street, Aldersgate.</p>

<p class='c006'>We must dismiss entirely all our present associations
with Aldersgate, and go back to the beginning of the
century, to the description given by Dr. Buss of the city
at the time when his parents made their home there—</p>

<p class='c014'>“At this time the city itself was separated by fields from the
village of Islington. It was the custom for pedestrians, especially
after dark, to collect at Aldersgate-bars in sufficient force to protect
each other from footpads, while crossing the fields to this village.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The site of the existing City Road Basin was a market garden,
thus utilized when the Grand Junction Canal Company extended
their waterway through the city to the Thames. From the village
of Islington to Highgate and Hampstead it was nearly all fields.
Copenhagen House stood in the midst of cornfields. This spot is
now the centre of New Smithfield Cattle Market.... The river
Fleet was then as wide as the New River, and was supplied with
boats for rowing. Excepting the Thames, it was the nearest river,
and also a favourite bathing-place for the youth of London.”</p>

<p class='c005'>There was probably no great change, as it was still
before the days of steam and rail, when the little granddaughter
of William Church Buss was sent to visit her
grandparents, who had then removed to Newgate Street.
Her maternal grandparents still lived in Clerkenwell,
near the market gardens there.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>William Church Buss was a very skilful engraver,
and his son, Robert William Buss, was trained by
him, and was a clever engraver before he became a
painter, and subsequently a well-known etcher on copper
and steel, and draughtsman for wood-engravers. Working
in this way, he illustrated the novels of Mrs. Trollope
and Captain Marryat, and other writers, and two of
the first etchings for “Pickwick” were his doing. For
Charles Knight he illustrated “Chaucer,” helping also
in the “Shakespeare,” “London,” and “Old England,”
issued by that publisher. Many of his own original
pictures were engraved and had wide sale, such as
“Soliciting a Vote,” “The Musical Bore,” “Satisfaction,”
“Time and Tide,” etc. And, with all this, he still found
time for lectures on “The Beautiful and Picturesque,”
on “Fresco,” and on “Comic Art”—this last re-written
at the close of his life, and dedicated to his daughter,
under the title of “Graphic Satire.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was when on a visit to her paternal grandparents,
in Newgate Street, that the future Educationalist made
her first acquaintance with school-life, after a very
quaint fashion, as she thus tells us—</p>

<p class='c014'>“To get me out of the way, my grandparents sent me to a
little school in the city, on a first floor, with a few forms, and, as
far as I remember, with no other appurtenances for a school at all.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The second school to which I went was kept by a Miss Cook—a
mixed school of boys and girls. In Miss Cook’s school we sat
on forms, and learned lessons which it never occurred to her to
explain. I remember learning a good deal of ‘Murray’s Grammar.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>In Frances Power Cobbe’s “Autobiography” she
tells us that the first practical result of her attainment
of the arts of reading and writing—throwing a lurid
light on the agonies of the process—was to inscribe on
the gravel walk, in large letters, “Lessons, thou tyrant
of the mind!” A similar inscription might have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>engraven for the benefit of Miss Cook by Frances
Mary Buss, after this prolonged course of Lindley
Murray without explanation. But she seems to have
found other solace. The tyranny of lessons was powerless
to crush this independent young mind, or to repress
an independence of action more suitable to the age of
“Revolting Daughters,” than to that of “Mrs. Trimmer”
or of “Evenings at Home.” Her next story tells how
she invited a little companion to a juvenile party, which
existed only in her own active imagination, until the
kind mother gave it objective reality, on hearing of
the small boy’s bitter disappointment. It might be at
this school that Miss Buss acquired that ideal of “mixed
schools” which she kept before her to the end, though
she knew it was not to become fact in her day.</p>

<p class='c006'>She was very far from spending her young life only in
sitting on a form, learning lessons by rote. “Children,”
says Mr. Ruskin, “should have times of being off duty,
like soldiers;” or, as Dr. Abbott puts the same truth
very clearly, “Children should have time to think their
own thoughts.” These privileges certainly did belong to
the children of the past, and, like many another clever
child, the little Fanny made full use of her liberty, for
she continues—</p>

<p class='c014'>“As soon as I could begin to read I revelled in books, and
especially fairy tales. I devoured every fairy tale that was to be
had. In those days the books available for children were ‘The
Pilgrim’s Progress,’ ‘Miss Edgeworth’s Tales,’  ‘The Arabian
Nights,’ and the old nursery stories. Of these I had single copies,
which I managed to buy out of the money given to me. I had, in
addition, translations of the Countess D’Aulnoy’s tales. As my
father had a very fair library for the date, and as I had access to
all his books, I had a wide course of reading. I knew Milton’s
introduction to ‘The History of England,’ with the legends of
Bladud, Lear, etc.; ‘Hume’s History,’ in every part, except the
political, which I invariably skipped; the novels of the eighteenth
century—‘Tom Jones,’ ‘Pamela,’ ‘The Man of Feeling,’ ‘Joseph
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>Andrews,’  ‘Peregrine Pickle,’ etc.  ‘Pamela’ was in four large
volumes, the first of which I could never get because my mother
hid it. At about ten years of age I became acquainted with
Scott’s novels, and knew all the stories by heart, except ‘Rob Roy,’
for which I did not care. My father had the  ‘Abbotsford Edition,’
with the poems, in twelve volumes. I never, however, read the
poetry. In consequence of my father being engaged to illustrate
books for Charles Knight, and for Bentley and Colburn, the
publishers, I used to have the opportunity of reading the proofs, by
going down, at six o’clock on summer mornings, to his room before
any one was there. I remember my chief difficulty, however, with
the proofs was paging them correctly; this I never learned to do,
and therefore I read the pages as they came, fitting them into my
mind properly afterwards. In that way I read Mrs. Trollope’s
‘Widow Married,’ Marryat’s  ‘Peter Simple,’ etc.... During this
early period of my life I must have become acquainted with the
contents of about forty volumes of plays, published by Cumberland.
There were also many volumes of plays of the previous
century, which I knew almost by heart. Amongst these were
volumes of Peruvian, Persian, and Turkish tales, belonging to a
young aunt, my mother’s sister, who lent them to me. In these
tales there was no attempt at connection, every person introduced
merely telling his or her own story.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I remember that, as my brother Alfred grew up, I used to
find it necessary, in order to enjoy my book, to hide myself under
a sofa, in a room on the second floor, which was occupied by a
Government clerk. This gentleman was out all day, and therefore
his room was available. My mother must have known this,
because we children—the boys at any rate—were not allowed to
go to this room.”</p>

<p class='c005'>At about the same time we find the insatiable child
reading Miss Strickland’s “Queens of England,” of
which she says “each volume came out by itself, and
I remember I used to save up all my pence to hire a
volume to read, and even at that early age I made
many notes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>History remained her favourite study, and her mode
of teaching it must have made it fascinating to her
pupils. One of these, afterwards a member of the staff,
remarks of it—</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>“I was at school from 1864–67, and the pleasantest part of the
time was the lessons I had in history, French, geography, and
literature from Miss Buss. How thorough her teaching was! It
seems to me that I have never forgotten what she taught, while
most of the lessons from others (except Dr. Hodgson and Miss
Chessar) seem to have passed away without leaving any definite
trace in my memory. Her lessons were alive; the historical
characters and scenes she described seemed as familiar as if one
had known them personally, and she made everything interesting
because she herself had such interest in what she taught.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Another of the old pupils says also—</p>

<p class='c014'>“But for picturesqueness and interest her history lessons excelled
all others. It was then she gave us ‘the cream of her life’s
reading,’ as I have heard her say. Two lectures specially remain
in my mind on ‘The Rise of the Hydes.’ There were many in the
class who lost not a point from beginning to end, so graphically
was the story presented to us.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And at any time, to the last, to hear her sum up
the characteristics of any special period, or describe any
great event, with her instinctively picturesque presentation
of the scene, was a treat of no common order.</p>

<p class='c006'>To this graphic power of description, her early
artistic surroundings must in no small degree have
contributed. At one time she taught drawing in her
class, but she never had the time for any artistic work
of her own. She had, however, keen and cultivated
artistic tastes, and her feeling for colour was especially
marked. Her visits to Italy intensified this delight in
colour, and she indulged it in ways sometimes regarded
as hazardous by eyes accustomed only to sober British
tints. But they were in the end obliged to admire these
innovations. She was among the first to appreciate
the new developments of decorative art, and Myra
Lodge and the Cottage at Epping revealed her taste at
every turn.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the account of the next stage of her school-life,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>we get glimpses of her social surroundings which show
that there must have been much to stimulate the child’s
eager and inquiring mind—</p>

<p class='c014'>“At ten years of age I was sent to a much higher school, kept
by Mrs. Wyand, at the corner of Rutland Street, Hampstead Road.
Here I met with the daughters of David Roberts, Clarkson Stanfield,
and other artists. Mr. Wyand had a boys’ school, largely
attended by the sons of artists. A few doors lower down lived
George Cruickshank. Clarkson Stanfield also lived in Mornington
Place; and, still nearer the school, Frederick Bacon, the engraver,
with whose niece and adopted daughter I was on the most intimate
terms. At a later date the daughters of Goodall entered the school,
and also Isabella Irving, the daughter of Edward Irving, a tall,
fine dark girl, very like her father. Her brother, Martin Irving,
was in the boys’ school.”</p>

<p class='c005'>We have to bear in mind that at this date Mornington
Crescent occupied much the same position, as a literary
and artistic centre, which is held by Hampstead at the
present day. Even as late as 1850, the westward
migrations had not begun, for market gardens filled
the space between Kensington High Street and Chelsea
proper, and Notting Hill Square was on the verge of
the country. In 1850, University and King’s Colleges
made a centre in the west central district; and the
establishment even of a Collegiate School for Ladies
was regarded as a slight infringement of the dignity
of Camden Street, which could boast at that date of
so choice an intellectual <i>cotérie</i> as Professor De Morgan,
Professor Key, Professor Hoppus, and Dr. Kitto. It
was near enough to town life, and yet near the
country, long stretches of green fields and flowery
hedges leading to the heights of Hampstead and
Highgate. Regent’s Park was the nearest of the parks,
and the New Road had not then outgrown the freshness
of its name.</p>

<p class='c006'>In these records of Miss Buss’ childhood we seem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>taken back to another world, as we read of the “long
coast journey to the Docks,” on the way to Margate,
when the child sees “the remains of the illuminations
of the day before for the celebration of the Princess
Victoria’s birthday.” In the next year also there are,
again at Margate, “triumphal arches in honour of the
Queen’s coronation.” And then there is the first sight
of the young Queen—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I had been taken to the park by my grandmother, and an
open carriage passed with three ladies in deep mourning—one
was the Queen, the other the Duchess of Kent, and the third a
lady in waiting. The following year I also saw the Queen in an
open carriage going to the Academy. She then wore a white
dress, and a very large bonnet lined with pink. I think she had
a green parasol.”</p>

<p class='c005'>On another occasion there is “a vision of scarlet
and of a mass of white drapery” as “the young couple
are returning from St. James’ Chapel on the Queen’s
birthday.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Very pleasant, in its old-fashioned simplicity, must
have been the life of this artistic circle, united in tastes
and occupations, and living, as it were, between town
and country, with the advantages of both. It was no
wonder that, under such influences, this child early
developed intellectual tastes. But her growth was
equal on all sides, love of books being only one of her
varied “talents.” She tells us—</p>

<p class='c014'>“At that date it was considered necessary that every girl
should work; and before I was ten years of age I had made
a shirt for my father, all the parts being cut out and arranged
by my mother, sewing machines not being then invented. So,
too, as it was long before the days of Peak and Frean, or Huntley
and Palmer, for our childish parties, I used to help my mother
make all the biscuits, as well as the cakes and tarts. I remember
one large grown-up party which my parents gave, on which occasion
the door was smoothed in some way, and a very handsome
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>border painted round it by my father (an elaborate design about
two feet wide). This was my first appearance among grown-up
people, and I quite well remember the delight I felt at the idea
of being asked to dance by a very tall man, an engraver, whose
name I forget, whom I met in after years and found to be very
insignificant. The <i>belles</i> of that evening were the Miss Cumberlands,
daughters of the publisher, for whom at that time my father
was painting a series of theatrical portraits.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Among the celebrated actors forming this series
were Charles Matthews, Reeve, Harley, Mrs. Nesbit,
Buckstone, Ellen Tree, Vandenhof, Macready, and
Dowton. At an early age “Fanny” had been taken
to the theatre, of which we learn that “at that date the
Sadler’s Wells Theatre was held in high repute. The
stage was very large, and being situated near the New
River was able to utilize a great deal of water.” We may
imagine the excitement of the children over the arrival
of these wonderful personages; how they peered silently
over the banisters, and how, when the sittings were over,
they stole into the studio to examine the costumes
which were left for the artist’s use, with what glee to
discover, for instance, that Vandenhof’s cap, in some
great character, was “made of a large blue sugar-bag
covered with some coloured material.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Amateur theatricals were a favourite amusement at
the young parties—at first, when the kind father was
the chief performer, in “a series of dancing card figures,
exhibited on a sheet as shadows, he writing and reading
the text;” afterwards, the performances were of more
ambitious character, at Mr. Wyand’s school, when the
boys were allowed to invite their sisters and friends,
and “where the plays were written by the boys, and
the women’s parts taken by boys, to our great delight,
as they invariably tumbled over their skirts.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In one play, the king’s part is taken by John
Blockley, son of the author of the then favourite song
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>“Love Not,” in a play in which the chief characters are
“King Edward” and the “Sultan of Turkey,” Edward
being a “tall, thin, shy lad, who in the meekest possible
way announced that while he lived no Turkish prince
should wield Edward’s sceptre” (a folded sheet of
exercise paper). “My brother Alfred contributed a large
cloak, lined with red, which continued to be a famous
piece of stage property. The swords, shields, etc.,
were made by my father.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The pupils who knew the school when Miss Buss
was in full vigour will read with interest these early
developments of the dramatic power which played such
part in the <i>tableaux vivants</i>, plays, charades, or costume
dances of that period. These entertainments, involving
parties counted by hundreds where ordinary folk have
units, were a great feature of school-life. They must
have formed a delightful break in that excessive study
so condemned by the world outside, which assuredly
in no wise prevented the most hilarious enjoyment of
these revels, shared by all, from the dignified head down
to the most frolicsome of the “little ones.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And for all readers it is pleasant to have these
glimpses of the happy home-life in which this loving
nature had such free room for growth. So much is
implied as we see the busy father making time for play
with his children, as well as for “writing letters on
grammar,” which the studious little daughter “used to
find on the stairs;” or again, as we note the good
mother, not less busy, kindly shutting her eyes to those
surreptitious studies under the sofa, instead of calling
on her only girl to take her part in amusing the
younger children, of whom, in course of time, one sister
and eight brothers made their appearance in the active
household. Of these, however, only four brothers
attained manhood.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>In later years the elder sister needed no bidding
to stand by the mother to whom she was devoted, and
whose comfort and stay she became in the long struggle
with the many claims on a narrow income. In those
days life was a struggle to even the most distinguished
artists, and fame was by no means synonymous with
fortune.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the natural course of things more than one
opportunity came to the girl to change this home
struggle for a life of her own under easier auspices.
And once she had felt the force of the temptation;
but duty had early become the watchword of her life;
and as she looked at the mother burdened with her
weight of cares, the good daughter, at a cost none
but herself could measure, turned from the dreams
of her girlhood, from the hopes of womanhood, and
kept her place by her mother’s side.</p>

<p class='c006'>Years afterwards in a few words she tells us all the
story—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have had real heart-ache, such as at intervals in earlier life
I had to bear: when I put aside marriage; when Mr. Laing died;
and again when my dearest mother, the brave, loving, strong,
tender woman, left all her children. I quite believe in heart-ache!
God’s ways are not our ways!”</p>

<p class='c015'>Of Miss Buss as a girl we have a very telling little
sketch in her own words, showing how this happy
childhood merged only too quickly into a girlhood
early fitting her for the strenuous life-work towards
which she was moving on through long silent years of
training.</p>
<p class='c014'>“I may as well take this opportunity of saying that within a
month after I had reached my fourteenth birthday I began to
teach, and that never since, with the exception of holidays and
two occasions of serious illness, have I spent my days out of a
schoolroom. I was in sole charge of a large school for a week at
a time when I was sixteen. When I was twenty-three I was
mistress of a large private school, containing nearly a hundred
pupils; that hundred was turned into two hundred by the time
I was twenty-five.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I mention these facts just to show you how intensely active
my life has been, for it is always to be borne in mind that in
addition to spending my days in the schoolroom, I had to gain the
whole of my education, such as it is, in the evening or in the
holidays, and that for some years in my early life there was a
great burden of money anxieties.</p>

<p class='c017'>“You will see that I have never, therefore, known leisure. Of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>late years, since the work has developed so much, I have done
less teaching, but until the last four or five years, and for some
years after the opening of the Cambridge Examinations, I was the
sole mistress of the highest class, teaching every subject in it—English,
French, German, and some Latin.</p>

<p class='c017'>“After the Cambridge Examinations began it was necessary to
be free one hour in the morning, in order to see what was going
on in other classes.</p>

<p class='c017'>“As a matter of fact, I have had to teach almost everything at
different times. For some years I assisted in the teaching of model
and freehand drawing.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Circumstances never seemed favourable for my having time
to do anything, so to speak, but live inside the schoolroom, and
there carry into practice such theories as crossed my mind. I
think it would have been much better for me if I had been able
to have had a greater knowledge of the <i>theory</i> of the profession
by private study, but hard practice has taught me something.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In one of this girl’s early sayings—“Why are women
so little thought of? I would have girls trained to
match their brothers!”—we have the key-note of her
harmonious life. It was experience transmuted into
sympathy. In the stress of her own girlish efforts she
gained her life-long feeling for the half-educated, on
whom is too early laid the burden of money getting.
Then, when occasion demanded, she was ready to give
up her own ease, and to undertake the heavy work
which has secured to thousands of wage-earning girls
the practical training of a thorough education.</p>

<p class='c006'>Not less plainly, also, do we see, in her desire to fit
herself for her own work, the first impetus to secure for
all teachers the training needed for their special calling;
an object ever close to her heart, and one in which her
success will be her strongest claim to the gratitude of
future generations.</p>

<p class='c006'>The claim of an increasing family was no doubt in
this, as in so many cases, the reason why the mother
and daughter opened the first school in Clarence Road.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>And then, like so many other sisters, this girl would
watch her brothers going off to school or college for the
studies in which she—<i>being a girl</i>—could have no share.
But, like many a good sister before and since, she
would contentedly put aside her own dreams or desires,
doing her best to help her brothers. Such sacrifice was
taken simply as the highest duty, and thus turned to
deepest delight; but we can see how this loving
obedience was in reality a storing up of energy for
the great revolution of which she had caught the earliest
intimations.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is a pleasant thought to take in passing that this
good sister—happier than many—had brothers equally
good. If she was all that a sister could be she found
in them good brothers, who were friends and fellow-workers,
helping her in all the great aims of her life.
Her eldest brother, the Rev. Alfred J. Buss, as clerk to
the governing body of the schools, quite relieved her
mind from all anxiety concerning business arrangements;
whilst the religious instruction given by the
Rev. Septimus Buss carried on the early tradition of
the school. There was a wide gap between the eldest of
the family and number seven, so that her relation with
this brother, after the mother’s death, was half maternal
as well as half sisterly. When he early became engaged to
her pupil, cousin, and friend, and thus gave her the truest
and most tender of sisters, the bond was doubled, and
the children of this beloved pair—her namesake <i>Francis</i>,
especially—became as her very own. Her letters are
full of allusion to “my boy,” who was her joy from his
peculiarly engaging babyhood till he fulfilled her heart’s
desire by taking Holy Orders. His next brother followed
in this example, first set by the son of the Rev.
A. J. Buss, now Minor Canon of Lincoln.</p>

<p class='c006'>This clerical bent was very strong in the family.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>As a boy, Alfred Joseph Buss shared his sister’s enthusiasm
for teaching, and for any hope of head-mastership
Holy Orders were essential. Before he was out of
his teens he became the first assistant-master in the
then newly opened North London Collegiate School
for Boys. He was also English tutor at one time to
the young Orleans princes. But later in life he found
himself drawn most strongly to the work of the parish
priest. Septimus Buss inherited so much of his father’s
genius, that he seemed destined for art, having a picture
in the Royal Academy whilst only nineteen years of
age. But, though in obedience to his father he worked
hard at painting, he still had his own intentions, and
worked harder at Greek and Latin. Knowing, however,
that there was at that time an extra strain upon
the family finances, he bravely kept his own wishes to
himself till he had earned the means of carrying them
out. The story of these two brothers is among the
helpful and instructive tales that ought some day to
be written, to show what can be done by high aims
and resolute will. Of both it may be said that they
are all the stronger as fighters in their splendid battle
against East End misery, because, in their own boyhood,
they knew how “to endure hardness as good
soldiers.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This attraction to the clerical profession was a
natural sequence to early associations. The most
powerful influence of Miss Buss’ girlish life was undoubtedly
that of her revered friend of whom Mrs.
Septimus Buss writes, when alluding to—</p>
<p class='c023'>“the earnest spiritual influence of the Rev. David Laing, who
built the church and schools of Holy Trinity, Kentish Town,
giving his whole fortune and his life to found the parish. His
teaching by precept and practice was self-sacrifice, and the large-hearted
charity that beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>all things, coupled with the wide culture that welcomed new
thought, and proved all things. His hospitable home was constantly
open to his parishioners, where he received them among
his cultured circle of literary, scientific, and artistic friends. He
at once took his stand by the North London Collegiate School,
while others waited till its success was sure. We, oldest of old
pupils, still thrill with somewhat of the past enthusiasm when we
recall his inspiring teaching. The band of devoted workers he
gathered round him in his parish—which was then almost unique
for the number of works of charity carried on in it, and for the
weekly lectures by Mr. S. C. Hall and others—testified to his
personal influence, the motive power of which was not what he
saw, but what he was.”</p>
<p class='c005'>In memory of her lamented friend, Miss Buss, after
his death, established six “Laing Scholarships,” by
which so many girls who needed this help received
a free education in her school. Thus for ten years
Mr. Laing’s memory was kept in mind. With the
changes of 1870 these Scholarships ceased, but Miss
Buss’ devotion to Mrs. Laing knew no intermission
till her old friend’s death in 1876; and Miss Fawcett
has an interesting little comment on this unfailing
thoughtfulness—</p>

<p class='c014'>“All associated with our dear friend must have been struck
with her loyalty and faithfulness to her old friends. I am thinking
especially of her treatment of Mrs. Laing, for so many years.
Sunday by Sunday she went to see her after morning service as
regularly as the day came round; flowers were sent to her very
frequently, also nice books to read. On her birthday Miss Buss
never failed to see her before the school-work began.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Among the school records there is a letter which
is of interest as showing the close relations which
existed between Mr. and Mrs. Laing and the school.
It is addressed to the chairman presiding at the first
prize-day after the double loss which made so sad a
change for the young head-mistress—the death within a
year of her mother and of Mr. Laing—</p>

<div class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>“<span class='sc'>Rev. and dear Sir</span>,</div>
<p class='c025'>“May I beg you to express my great regret at the
impossibility of my being at your meeting to-day? I do not say
that it would not have been very painful to attend, when two so
loved and honoured are missing since we last assembled for the
same purpose; but it is still more painful to stay away. I wished
to show my true interest in the cause Mr. Laing had so much at
heart; my warm regard for the friends he so much valued; my
deep sense of the respect and affection shown to his memory in
the establishment of the Laing Scholarships.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Many to-day will remember how in much pain and weakness
he filled his place last year, but a few days before he took to the
bed whence he was to rise no more. It was the last evidence he
was permitted to give of his feeling with regard to the work carried
on here; and I feel I can do nothing better than adopt that which
in various ways he has so often said to me,  ‘Miss Buss is doing
a great and good work. Hundreds will rise up and call her
blessed.’</p>
<p class='c026'>“I am, yours faithfully,</p>
<p class='c027'>“<span class='sc'>Mary E. Laing</span>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>To the influence of Mr. Laing, and of his no less
admirable wife, Miss Buss owed much of the mental
and moral breadth for which she was afterwards so
distinguished. In their home she was always welcome,
finding a never-failing sympathy and encouragement.
Often in our quiet talks she delighted to refer to these
early memories, speaking of the advantage such a friendship
had been to her in her young life; and to this
grateful memory it is probable that many of her own
young assistants, especially those least fortunate in
their social surroundings, may have owed much of the
thoughtful kindness so valuable to girls beginning their
career as teachers.</p>

<p class='c006'>With the knowledge of the satisfaction she would
have felt in fuller recognition of Mr. Laing’s services
to education in general, as well as in particular to her
own school, it will not be out of place here to give
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>some notes supplied by the Rev. A. J. Buss, with his
own comment on them—</p>

<p class='c014'>“There is much that I would say about the connection with
Mr. Laing—about himself as a great leader (almost unacknowledged)
in the educational movement of the latter half of this
century. To me the question is an interesting one, for I loved
Mr. Laing as a young man, and cherish his memory as most
precious now that I am advanced in life. It is at least remarkable
that he who, as honorary secretary and a member of the Board of
Management of the Governesses’ Benevolent Institution, took some
part in the foundation of Queen’s, should have been a prime mover in
the foundation of that school which has become the North London
Collegiate School for Girls, and has rendered possible, and given
such impetus to, the higher education of girls and women.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The story of the rise of Queen’s College is of interest
from many points of view, beyond that concerning our
present purpose of showing the influences that inspired
Frances Mary Buss with her special zeal for education.
In knowing Mr. Laing she came into direct touch with
the newest educational effort, and must have heard the
whole question discussed from all sides.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Laing, in 1843, rescued the Governesses’ Benevolent
Institution from decay, remaining its active
honorary secretary till his death in 1860. This society
was formed—</p>
<p class='c023'>“with the idea of benefiting governesses in every possible way;
to help in temporary difficulty; to provide annuities for aged
governesses; to help the younger to help themselves; to provide
a home for governesses during engagements, and an asylum for
the aged; also a system of registration, free of expense, to those
seeking engagements.”</p>
<p class='c005'>The whole of these objects were contemplated in
1843, and, in 1844, were a matter of negotiation with
the National Society, with the Committee of Council,
and with the heads of the Church.</p>

<p class='c006'>In giving an account of the early work—as a reply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>to an article in <i>Fraser’s Magazine</i> (July, 1849), commenting
unfavourably on the efforts that were then
made—Mr. Laing shows that with the foundation of
the Governesses’ Benevolent Institution the first principles
of all future movements were really incorporated.
He says—</p>

<p class='c014'>“In undertaking an institution for the benefit of governesses,
it was felt to be absurd and short-sighted to remedy existing evils
without an attempt at their removal.... To do this the character
of the whole class must be raised, and there was the bright thought
that to raise the character of governesses as a class was to raise
the whole tone of Christian society throughout the country.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But it was easier to plan such a college than to
carry out these plans, and several years passed without
practical results. Reference is made, year by year, on
the subject, in the annual reports of the Governesses’
Benevolent Institution.</p>

<p class='c006'>In that for 1845, we find that “difficulties which
the committee had not anticipated, have arisen with
the several authorities, from whom Boards of Examiners,
with power to grant a diploma of qualification, might
originate.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In the report for 1846, “an act of incorporation and
arrangements for a diploma” are still “subjects of consideration,
upon which the committee are prepared to
enter into communication with all parties friendly to
the cause. Unexpected difficulties still intervene.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was in 1848 that the Governesses’ Benevolent
Institution received a royal charter of incorporation,
thus worded—</p>

<p class='c014'>“We have been graciously pleased to permit the name of
<i>Queen’s College</i>, in which certificates of qualification are granted
to governesses, and in which arrangements have been made with
professors of high talent and standing in society to open classes
in all branches of female education.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Queen’s College was governed by a council of
gentlemen, and its first principal, Professor Maurice,
was followed by Professor Plumptre. A committee
of lady-visitors was formed, but the duties of these
ladies was merely to be present while the teaching
was done by men. Among them we find the familiar
names of Mrs. S. C. Hall, Mrs. Marcet, Miss Maurice,
Mrs. Kay Shuttleworth, and Mrs. Hensleigh Wedgwood.</p>

<p class='c006'>It would appear, from the report of 1849, that while
the Governesses’ Benevolent Institution was thus working
for better education for women and girls, other
schemes had been proposed, first by Miss Murray, one
of her Majesty’s ladies in waiting, and then by the
professors of King’s College. Eventually, the formation
of a Committee of Education, of which Mr. Laing and
Professors Maurice and Nicolay were active members,
brought things to a practical point, as Professor Nicolay
states<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c018'><sup>[4]</sup></a> that the “Committee of Education,” thus formed,
did its work in connection with, if not actually for, the
Governesses’ Benevolent Institution.</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f4'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r4'>4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the <i>English Education Journal</i>, 1849.</p>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In his inaugural lecture at Hanover Square, in 1848,
Professor Maurice shows how this institution, beginning
with a provision for distress among governesses, came
to associate distress with incompetency, and hence to
provide better instruction. In like manner, beginning
as examiners, the professors soon found that before
they could examine they must first teach, and for this
purpose organized the classes that grew into Queen’s
College.</p>

<p class='c006'>In <i>Fraser’s Magazine</i>, early in the fifties, are to be
found several papers concerning the foundation of
Queen’s College, thus finally summed up by the
editor—</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>“With reference to the article on Queen’s College in our last
number, Mr. Laing, as Hon. Sec. to the Governesses’ Benevolent
Institution, desires us to state that the society was in communication
with the Government and other parties respecting the establishment
of the college as early as 1844, whilst there was no
communication with the present professors until 1847; and that
her Majesty granted to the society the permission to use the
Royal name for the college before any connection was formed with
the present professors.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Whilst, therefore, the success of the college is wholly
attributable to the character and talents of its teachers, the college
would have existed under any circumstances.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In the same year, six months later, Bedford College
was founded, mainly by Mrs. Reid and Miss Bostock,
and among the ladies interested we find many names
afterwards prominent in the movement for opening
the Universities to women, as those of Lady Romilly,
Lady Belcher, Mrs. (afterwards Lady) Crompton, Mrs.
(afterwards Lady) Goldsmid, Mrs. Jameson, Mrs.
Bryan Walter Procter, Lady Pollock, Miss Julia Smith,
Mrs. Strutt (afterwards Lady Belper), Miss Emily
Davies, Miss Anna Swanwick, and Mrs. Hensleigh
Wedgwood.</p>

<p class='c006'>One distinct difference between Queen’s College
and Bedford College is that the first was managed by
men, with a man as the principal and women only as
lady-visitors. Bedford College had from the first a
mixed committee, and the visitor who represented the
head might be of either sex. Latterly Miss Anna
Swanwick has held this post. Results seem to indicate
the advantage of giving women an equal share in the
education of girls.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was by Mr. Laing’s introduction that Miss Buss
became one of the first pupils of the evening classes
at Queen’s College. The Queen’s College of that day
(1848) bore little resemblance to the colleges of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>quarter of a century later, but there was an enormous
stride onwards in the curriculum offered to its first
pupils.</p>

<p class='c006'>In her “History of Cheltenham College,” Miss Beale
gives us a glimpse of these classes—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Queen’s College offered to grant certificates to governesses....
My sisters and I were amongst some of the first to offer ourselves
for examination. For Holy Scripture the examiner was the
Rev. E. H. Plumptre, afterwards Dean of Wells, so well known for
his Biblical Commentaries, his great learning, and his translations
of the Greek dramatists and Dante. He also examined in classics.
In modern history and literature we had the pleasure of being
examined by Professor Maurice. The <i>viva voce</i> was a delightful
conversation; he led us on by his sympathetic manner and kindly
appreciation so that we hardly remembered he was an examiner.
For French and German our examiners were Professors Brasseur
and Bernays; for mathematics, Professor Hall and Mr. Cock; for
music, Sterndale Bennett; and for pedagogy, the head of the
Battersea Training College.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The names of the Rev. Charles Kingsley, for English
literature and composition; of Professor Nicolay, for
history and geography; and of Professor Hullah, for
vocal music, also appear on the list.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was of classes like these that, as a girl of twenty-one,
Frances Mary Buss became a happy pupil. Her
father’s interest in art and science had prepared her
to enter into the spirit of such teaching, and to profit
by the influence of the great men who threw their
whole souls into their work. What this meant to
the girls thus privileged is shown in lives like those of
Miss Buss, Miss Beale, Miss Frances Martin, or Miss
Julia Wedgwood, and many more perhaps less known
to fame.</p>

<p class='c006'>A memory comes back to me of an evening in 1881,
spent at Myra Lodge, where the difference between the
old and the new order of things was emphasized in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>marked degree. Standing out from the far past, as
precursors of the new era, were Miss Buss herself, Miss
Beale, and Miss Frances Martin; midway, as a Schools
Inquiry Commissioner, was Mr. J. G. Fitch; while the
moderns bloomed out in Dr. Sophie Bryant, one of the
earliest Cambridge Local candidates, and the very first
woman-Doctor of Science; Miss Rose Aitkin, B.A.,
stood for the arts; and, I think, Miss Sara A. Burstall
(since B.A.) as the first girl who had, like her brothers,
educated herself by her brains, passing, largely by
scholarships, up from the Camden School, through the
Upper School, and on to Girton.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was a thing to remember to hear how the three
elder women spoke of the old and new days, and then
to see what had been done for the girls through their
efforts. Miss Buss told us many things of her girlhood,
and her difficulties in fitting herself for her work; and
especially of the stimulus and delight of the new world
of thought and feeling opened by those first lectures.
Miss Beale and Miss Martin, coming later, had enjoyed
all the advantages of Queen’s College, but they did not
the less appreciate those first lectures. As they spoke
in glowing terms of Professor Maurice, one could not
but wish that he might have been there to see the
three grand women who have done so much for womanhood—pupils
worthy of even such a master.</p>

<p class='c006'>The picture fixed itself in my mind of Frances
Mary Buss, in the first ardour of this new intellectual
awakening. She was teaching all day in her own school,
so that she could take only the evening classes. There
were at that time no omnibuses, and night after night,
her day’s work done, the enthusiastic girl walked from
Camden Town to Queen’s College and back. Night
after night she sat up into the small hours, entranced
by her new studies, preparing thus not only for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>papers which won for her the desired certificates, but
for that greater future of which she did not then even
dream.</p>

<p class='c006'>In her Autobiography, Miss Cobbe gives a very telling
summary of the education of the earlier part of this
century, in her account of the particular school in which
her own education had been, as it was called, “finished,”
at a cost, for two years, of £1000. How she <i>began</i> it
for herself afterwards she also tells, but of this finished
portion she thus writes—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nobody dreamed that any one of us could, in later life, be
more or less than an ornament to Society. That a pupil in that
school should become an artist or authoress would have been
regarded as a deplorable dereliction. Not that which was good
or useful to the community, or even that which would be delightful
to ourselves, but that which would make us admired in society
was the <i>raison d’être</i> of such requirement.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The education of women was probably at its lowest ebb
about half a century ago. It was at that period more pretentious
than it had ever been before, and infinitely more costly; and it
was likewise more shallow and senseless than can easily be
believed. To inspire young women with due gratitude for their
present privileges, won for them by my contemporaries, I can
think of nothing better than to acquaint them with some of the
features of school-life in England in the days of their mothers. I
say advisedly in those of their mothers, for in those of their grandmothers
things were by no means equally bad. There was much
less pretence, and more genuine instruction, so far as it extended.”</p>

<p class='c005'>We are justified in the conclusion that Mrs. Wyand’s
school, in which Frances Mary Buss received her training,
as pupil and then as assistant, was one of the
survivals from this olden time. From one of the
pupils, who was there as a child while Miss Buss was
assistant-mistress, we have a sketch of Mrs. Wyand
as a slight, erect little lady, with very dark eyes, and
with black hair, in the ringlets of that era, confined
on each side by tortoiseshell side-combs. She always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>wore long rustling silk gowns, and altogether was an
impressive personage, before whom the most volatile
schoolgirl at once grew staid and sober. Mention of
Miss Buss herself seems limited to a certain satisfaction
in having carried provocation to so great an extent
as to make the young teacher cry. But we may easily
imagine that before the end of that encounter the tables
were turned, and that then may have begun the treatment
of “naughty girls” so successful in later life.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thanks to the good training received under Mrs.
Wyand, Miss Buss was able, at the age of eighteen, to
take an active part in the school opened by Mrs. Buss
in Clarence Road. Before she was twenty-three she
had gained the Queen’s College Diploma, and she then
became the head of the new school in Camden Street,
which was the outcome of this first venture.</p>

<p class='c006'>The course of instruction included most of the
subjects now taught, and Miss Eleanor Begbie—who
claims to have been the first pupil in Camden Street,
and who has been superintendent of the Sandall Road
School, familiar, therefore, with all new methods—affirms
confidently that the Science and Art classes taken by
Mr. Buss were “as good, and quite as interesting, as
anything given now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This is confirmed by Mrs. Pierson, who says of these
very happy school-days—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Her dear father greatly added to the enjoyment of school
life by giving us courses of lectures illustrated by diagrams on
geology, astronomy, botany, zoology, and chemistry, quite equal
to those given by highly paid professors of the present day, and
he gave them for love, and nothing extra was put down in the
bills, although each course was an education by itself, given in
his lucid and most interesting way.”</p>

<p class='c005'>These lectures, as Mrs. S. Buss says in her reminiscences—</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>“awakened in many a pupil the thirst for reading and study.
His artistic talent, and the pleasant excursions for sketching from
Nature, were novel inspirations in the days when the ordinary
girlish specimens of copied drawings resembled nothing in Nature.
A good elocutionist himself, he taught us to read and recite with
expression.”</p>

<p class='c005'>His daughter had the same gift, inherited or acquired,
and her school has always been specially distinguished
in all examinations for the excellence of the reading.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. S. Buss mentions, in addition to Mrs. Laing, as
also specially interested in the school—</p>

<p class='c014'>“the Rev. Canon Dale, Vicar of St. Pancras, and his two sons,
Pelham and Lawford Dale; the Rev. Cornelius Hart, Vicar of
Old St. Pancras; the Rev. R. P. Clemenger, Vicar of St. Thomas’,
Agar Town; the Revs. E. Spooner and Charles Lee, the immediate
successors of Mr. Laing; the Countess of Hardwicke, one
of the earliest and most faithful friends of the school, whose
daughter, Lady Elizabeth Biddulph, still continues the yearly
prize for good conduct, and whose warm letter of sympathy, in
January, was one of the many we received. We all remember,
too, Judge Payne, and his witty impromptu verses at so many
prize-givings.”</p>

<p class='c005'>When we listen to these memories of the earlier
school-days, we cannot dispute the position that—</p>

<p class='c014'>“The foundation of the North London Collegiate School for
Ladies was not merely the commencement of one special school,
but was an era in education. If we <i>very old pupils</i> can carry our
mind back to the time when the ‘Guide to Knowledge’ and
‘Mangnall’s Questions’ were the chief standard school-books for
most of the scientific and historical instruction that girls received;
when the mildest <i>form</i> of gymnastics (such as jumping over a stick
held a few inches above the ground) was deemed so unladylike
that some girls were withdrawn from the earliest classes formed;
when the study of the most rudimentary physiology horrified the
Mrs. Grundies of the period, who would not permit their daughters
to continue the course after the first lesson (like the mother of
later times at the primary school, who wrote to the teacher, ‘Mrs.
S—— asks that my Mary Jane do not go again to those lessons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>where they talk about their bodies: first, which it is nasty; and
second, which it is rude!’); the time when we learnt pages of
dictionary, with meanings, <i>in the first class</i>, and rules of dry-as-dust
grammar, without any meaning to us for years afterwards;
the time when it was asserted and believed, that a girl’s mind was
incapable of grasping any mathematical knowledge beyond the
first four rules of arithmetic;—we can, remembering those good old
times, see what a wonderful stride was taken in girls’ education by
the North London Collegiate School, even in its infancy. Can we
not recall those long tramps, to and fro, when the present North
London Railway ran only between Chalk Farm and Fenchurch
Street, and when there was no service of omnibuses between the
various districts? Fares, even when a conveyance could be had,
were fares, sixpence or a shilling. Do we not remember the overskirts
insisted on by Miss Buss as a protection from the wet, at a
time when waterproof clothing was unknown? What dressing and
undressing went on round the stove, where <i>Miss Reneau</i> sat with
the default list, to put down the name of any too riotous girl!
What a delight the giant strides and see-saws were to the athletic
young damsels of the period, while the more staid elders waited
anxiously for the chance of a turn with the dear head-mistress, who
gave up her hour of leisure to talk and walk with us on the playground,
and give us a word of sympathy, counsel, or encouragement,
or tell some funny story, or teach some new game, sharing
her brimming cup of life with us all—ever regardless of her own
need of rest!”</p>

<p class='c005'>From letters at this period we have a glimpse of
this young head-mistress at work and at play, both of
which she did very thoroughly. The work must have
been rather overdone, and we may admire the self-control
which is remembered as so marked a characteristic, when
we see that it came from real self-conquest. In 1859
she writes to her brother Septimus, speaking of herself
and her cousin Maria (Mrs. Septimus Buss)—</p>

<p class='c014'>“As usual at this period—and, for that matter, at most periods—of
the year, we are over-worked. At times I am so irritable I
feel inclined to throw things at people, and twice this week I
have allowed myself to be provoked into a fit of temper. It
is so grievous afterwards to reflect upon. Why was I made so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>gunpowdery? I do think, however, the provocation was very
great, though that, of course, is no excuse.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The next letter is to her father in holiday-time:—</p>

<div class='c024'>“Dinan, 1860.</div>

<p class='c017'>“Everything has combined to make this holiday delightful, and
I am so well and happy, that I feel as if I was only twenty years
of age, instead of a hundred, as I do in Camden Street. I find
myself talking slang to the boys, and actually shouting fag-ends of
absurd choruses from mere lightheartedness.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am very sorry to say that I do not feel any more industrious,
though doubtless I shall have to recover from that complaint in
London. Also I regret to say that I have to-day incurred the
severe displeasure of our wee blue-eyed laddie!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am always thinking of the first time I ever saw her—in the
old house in Camden Street, when I was seven years old, a timid
child, sent upstairs with a message, which I stood and mumbled at
the door. I remember her now—an elegant dark young lady, she
seemed to me—with curls and a low-necked dress, as we all had
then. She told me to come forward and deliver my message as if
I wasn’t frightened; and I remember now how her vigorous intensity
seemed to sweep me up like a strong wind. And that is
forty-four years ago!”</p>

<p class='c005'>This graphic sketch, from the pen of Mrs. Alfred
Marks, gives us the young head of the new school as
she must have looked in 1850, when the first venture in
Clarence Road became the North London Collegiate
School for Ladies, reconstructed after the lines of
Queen’s College, founded two years before.</p>

<p class='c006'>Among the many appreciative notices with which
the entire press of England met the news of the death
of one of the foremost educators of the time, none went
so straight to the mark as that of a country paper, the
<i>Bath Herald</i>, which seized on the most distinctive point
of this remarkable personality. After observing that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>it is rare for the influence of a school-mistress to be felt
beyond her immediate circle, it thus proceeds—</p>

<p class='c014'>“There is not a county of her native country, not a colony of
its empire, where the news of this death will not have saddened
the hearts of pupils and friends.</p>

<p class='c017'>“When she began her great work the matter of girls’ education
was still a ‘question.’ Miss Buss solved it in the most direct and
practical fashion; and every college for women, and every high
school for girls, is a memorial of her labours. A personality of
singular charm, and of what the slang of the day calls ‘magnetism,’
wholly without pedantry or self-consciousness, persuaded Royal
Commissioners, City Companies, Lord Mayors and Royal Princesses,
physicians, and even Universities, that women might be
thoroughly educated without any danger to themselves or the State.
To mention her name to any one of the many thousand pupils
scattered over the face of the earth, was to raise constantly
emotions of affection and pride. Undoubtedly she was one of
the ‘pioneers’ of the century, and is secure of a niche in the
temples of memory and of fame.”</p>

<p class='c005'>These words are written at the end of her career,
but they were true from the beginning. It is most
truly characteristic of her that her power was exercised
without self-consciousness. On one occasion I had remarked
on her wonderful influence, and find her answer
in a brief sentence, after which she turns to some more
practical subject with her instinctive distaste for introspection
or self-dissection: “What you say about
personal influence strikes me curiously. I cannot possibly
measure it or even understand it. To a certain
extent I am conscious of an influence over young girls,
but am not able to explain it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>To those who knew her well, the explanation comes
readily enough as we find her power of impressing
others to be the result of the vividness of her sympathy,
and of the imagination which, transcending mere personal
limitations, is able actually to enter into the life
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>of others, no matter how diverse in temperament or in
circumstances.</p>

<p class='c006'>Speaking of her as she was in middle life, Mrs.
Marks offers a suggestion full of interest, as she says—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Her utter spontaneity, her sense of people and things in their
living essences, made a very deep and lasting impression on me.
And some kind words she said to me—which showed she had seen
into my very heart—were a greater encouragement to me than I
can express. Their meaning was that she felt I was spontaneous,
and had not settled down into conventionality; and as things
were very real to me, it was a comfort to know that she too thought
them so.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It was doubtless as a direct consequence of this
vision of the “soul of things” that the mere <i>names</i> of
things meant so much more to Miss Buss than to most
of us, to whom in general a name is the mere husk of
the thing it stands for. Seeing through these names
as she did, they stood to her for all the living reality
of which they were the symbols. With the <i>name</i>, she
came into possession of all that went to make up the
personality represented by it. Surroundings, time, place,
with every other relation, became an inseparable part
of any name that once fixed itself in this truly royal
memory. To every one who met her it was a standing
wonder how she could know so much of the thousands
of girls who had passed under her care. That she did
know them is a fact that comes into almost every
memorial relating to her, from those first simple days
when she gave herself without stint to the little band
of pupils, up to the very last, when her circle of influence
was bounded only by the bounds of the empire itself.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is not surprising that so many of these girls should
bear for life the impress of this strong influence. But
still there is something to call for comment in the
depth of the feeling thus aroused. Before even the
suggestion of approaching death had lifted the veil of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>commonplace, which so often hides from us the beauty
of those with whom we walk the dusty path of everyday
life, there came, in answer to questions about the “story
of the school,” so many reminiscences of the early days,
giving the freshness of early enthusiasm, all undimmed
by the daily intercourse of nearly fifty years, that one
could not but marvel.</p>

<p class='c006'>Many of those first pupils have remained as teachers,
many others have settled in the neighbourhood as friends,
and to not a few this deep affection has been the master-passion
of their lives. In the wisdom of these later
times it is thought well to chill the fervour of the too
engrossing devotion to which very young enthusiasts
are prone. But nothing seems to have checked the
ardour of these early days, while only good has resulted
from a love which has moulded so many lives to strength
and beauty.</p>

<p class='c006'>One of the old pupils says of this time—</p>

<p class='c014'>“She was true, so staunch, so utterly wanting in all the little
pettinesses that so often mar even noble characters, that it is no
wonder we, her own girls, made a ‘hero’ of her and worshipped
her. But it was a noble worship, and killed our selfishness. We
wanted not so much her approbation, but to live such lives that,
could she know them, might deserve her approval.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And another, of later date, commenting on the
modern repression of youthful enthusiasm, fixes on
the point that essentially divides the influence that is
only life-giving from that which is sickly and morbid—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Any devotion roused by her love and care for those brought
into contact with her never savoured of this foolish adoration,
because her sympathy, though so personal, was in a sense so
impersonal and altruistic. She helped people because they wanted
help, and not that <i>she</i> might be an absorbing personality to them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Of a piece with the selflessness of such ministry is
another characteristic mentioned by the same writer—</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>“There is one point which always specially struck and helped
me, and that was the wonderful way she had of bringing together
people who would help each other by virtue of her sympathetic
insight into character. Many most fruitful friendships must owe
their origin to her loving thought. Even when, from the fulness
of her own life, she was unable, to the same extent in the small
details, to ‘mother’ all her ‘children,’ yet she always had some
friend or ‘other child’ ready to go on with what she had begun.”</p>

<p class='c005'>How she could keep to her old friends, when the
pupil grew up to closer intimacy, is shown in one of
the letters written to me while she was still amongst
us. It is also touching in the light it throws on her
relation to the sanctities and sorrows of quiet home-life,
and what she could be to those who needed her.
It is happy to remember that in the lovely home of
this dear pupil-friend the beloved teacher found rest
and refreshment in many a weary time; and we may
thank Mrs. Pierson for this glimpse into that deeper
life, of which she writes from a full heart—</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is not often that ladies contend for the honour of age, but
Miss Begbie and I have had one or two friendly squabbles as to
which of us is the elder  ‘old pupil.’ <i>I think</i> it was the second
term of the opening of dear Miss Buss’ school, in 1850, that I
became one of her happy pupils, and from that day to this she
has been my loving guide and friend, sharing many deep sorrows
and deeper joys. She has been so great an influence in my life
that I have always felt I could realize the verse,  ‘For a good man
some would even dare to die.’</p>

<p class='c017'>“In those early days we were a comparative handful of girls,
and had the benefit of Miss Buss’ society nearly all to ourselves,
enjoying the very cream of her young life, intellect, and
enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It was all like fairyland teaching to me, and in the exuberance
of my enjoyment, I am obliged to confess that I was a
little troublesome, and often managed to upset the equilibrium of
the class, bringing upon myself the ordeal of a lecture in Miss
Buss’ private room after school. I always went into that room
raging like a young lioness, but invariably came out a plaintive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>lamb, vowing never to offend again. In order to comfort and
soothe my passionate grief, dear Miss Buss often kept me to tea
with her and her pleasant family party, and I fear that that enjoyment
had a demoralizing effect upon my good resolutions.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I was motherless when I first knew Miss Buss, and had been
utterly spoilt by an over-indulgent father until he married again
a lady quite out of sympathy with a girl of fourteen. I should
have turned into a veritable fury, and ended in perdition, if I had
not come across the spiritual influence of dear Miss Buss. She
supplied every want in my soul, and I gladly gave myself to her
loving guidance, often falling, but always encouraged, until in after
years I was strong enough to be able to part with life’s best
treasures one by one, and to say—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c028'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘It is well with my husband,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>It is well with my child.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c029'>“I could fill a volume with all dear Miss Buss has enabled me
to be, to do and to suffer, and with what she has been to me
through all—and <i>not to me only</i>, for all the girls of my time
worshipped her, and she never of <i>her</i> own accord loses touch with
an old pupil. But what I have said will doubtless suffice for your
purpose.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A large volume might indeed be filled with
“memories”—extending from those early days till a
year ago—of the kindness and sympathy ever flowing
out from that time to this. It seemed to me very
striking when the same post brought two letters—one
dating back to 1850, the other only to 1890—and,
spite of the forty years between, telling just the same
story.</p>

<p class='c006'>The one shows us the young teacher standing at the
parlour door, “with a kiss for each pupil at the end of
the day’s work,” with a “grace of manner and gentle
voice” deeply impressing the child to whom for forty-four
years afterwards she became “ever a most kind
and constant friend, ever ready with sympathy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Then comes a picture of a wild, daring girl, dashing
to the end of the long garden and back in the rain, on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>her return to be called into the parlour to account for
herself. Of the reproof she adds—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I remember little but its gentleness, and the kind arm round
me while it was being given; but, at the end, I was required to
promise never to do anything because I was dared to do it. After
that Miss Buss led me by a silken thread all through my school-days,
though the other teachers often found me headstrong and
troublesome.”</p>

<p class='c005'>There is an account of how Miss Buss ended a
standing feud between the girl and “Mademoiselle” by
the exaction of a promise from the reluctant pupil that
she would set herself to win the French prize. And
finally comes the graver side of this happy relation—</p>

<p class='c014'>“When at the age of thirteen I left school to go abroad, Miss
Buss still continued her kindness, writing to me while I was away,
and giving me kind welcome on my return. To see her again was
always my first thought after the home-greeting.</p>

<p class='c017'>“After my first trouble she wrote thus to me—</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘I feel much for you, dear E——.  Your experience of life
is beginning early, and so is your discipline. Discipline, though
wholesome, is never pleasant. And then, when one is young, one’s
feelings are so acute. I remember what I went through at your
age, and under similar circumstances. Nevertheless, my greater
experience than yours, poor child, makes me confess that “tribulation
worketh patience.” Amidst all your trials, dear E——, always
trust me. I do not intend to let a light thing come between me
and “auld lang syne” folks.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>The second letter is also from one of the madcap
order—a wilful, high-spirited bit of mischief, fascinating
in her pranks, but often enough a source of real anxiety
to her teachers, and even to the dignified head herself,
known to this child only when almost worn out with
the long strain of school-life and of her heavy public
work. But here are words as straight from the child’s
heart as from that of the woman who could count back
through nearly fifty years of friendship—</p>

<div class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>“Jan. 31, 1895.</div>

<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Miss Edwards</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“There is so much I want to say, but I do not know
how to say it. This distance is so awful.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I think it is because I cannot realize that I shall never see
Miss Buss again. If I were near I could realize it better; it seems
more like some fearful dream to me.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I wish I was near you to tell you how deeply I sympathize
and share in the sorrow that I know the loss of so kind and true a
friend must be to you.</p>

<p class='c017'>“And how many hundreds of girls will feel the same!</p>

<p class='c017'>“All the world over there will be hearts aching to think that
they will never see Miss Buss again.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I can but judge others by myself, and I know that it was not
till I had left school, and had been out here some time, that I
realized more fully what a great blessing had been mine that I
had been allowed to know Miss Buss; that, while I was at the
age when girls most need loving, firm guidance, I should have had
<i>Her</i> for a kind teacher and friend. It will always be to me one of
the best and happiest remembrances of my life, for I truly feel it
a great honour bestowed on me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>There will always be the two kinds of girl—the one
who is content with the life of the present moment,
and the one who “looks before and after,” to whom
the present moment is only a fixed point between
past and future. In speaking for herself, one of the
first kind speaks for many more, as she naïvely says,
“I fancy we were too much occupied with ourselves
to think much about Miss Buss while we were at
school!” The second class speak for themselves
in every variety of intensity, but all to the same purpose:
“No one can ever know what she was to me.
All that I am, and all that I have, I owe to her influence
or to her help!” Over and over comes the
same cry, in which the blank of present loss foretells
the future loneliness bereft of the strength and comfort
of the past.</p>

<p class='c006'>From one of the younger pupils we have again the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>growing sense of what she had less kindly felt at the
moment—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I feel that there are so many women, not in England only,
but all over the world, who will rise up to call her ‘blessed.’ As
time goes on I more appreciate the training I had under her, and
it seems to me now, that but for her influence I could not possibly
have fulfilled the home and public duties that have fallen to my
lot, and that it has been a pleasure to me to undertake.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And yet another—</p>

<p class='c014'>“We who were with her in the impressionable days of our
youth must all feel how much we owe her, in the view of life she
gave us, and the tone of healthy energy she brought into our lives.
I am sure her loss will be as widely felt as that of Arnold by his
old pupils long ago.”</p>

<p class='c005'>To give the experience of all who come back year
by year to give a record of their work in hospital ward
or East End slum, in home workhouses or foreign
missions, would be too heavy a task; but, as illustrative
of the wide range of influence exercised in matters
social and philanthropic, we may give a letter from one
in whom the “Gospel of Work” found an apt disciple.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Heberden, one of the first three ladies elected
as lady guardians in St. Pancras, was, as Sarah Ward
Andrews, one of the pupils of the second decade, dating
from 1861, but she has the same record of delight in the
teaching and the same devotion to the teacher as those
of earlier date. What most impressed her, however, she
gives as follows:—</p>

<p class='c014'>“During my stay Miss Buss’ mother died, and though in great
sorrow, she continued all her work. I remember her remark that,
‘Work, originally a curse to mankind, was now a blessing, not
permitting us to dwell on our trials and losses.’ From that time
Miss Buss was a great factor for all that is best and highest in my
life; and when, in 1873, I lived near her in Hampstead, I was
brought into active public life by her request. She asked me to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>help in the School Board election of that year, when Miss Chessar
and Mrs. Cowell were returned for Marylebone.</p>

<p class='c017'>“All the great interest I have taken in women’s work began
then, encouraged by Miss Buss’ earnest sympathy and advice.</p>

<p class='c017'>“In 1880 I was elected Poor Law Guardian in St. Pancras, for
the ward in which Holy Trinity Church stands, where Miss Buss
had attended for a long time. Her name secured me much
support; without it, I doubt if I should have been returned, for
the opposition to Women Guardians was then very great, and the
difficulties enormous. Miss Buss’ counsel was most valuable to
me at this time as always, so wise and judicious. ‘Forward, but
not too fast,’ was ever her motto.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Here is another word to the same purpose, from
an East End hospital:—</p>

<p class='c014'>“How many lives will be impoverished now! She was so true
and great-hearted. Wasn’t it wonderful how she remembered the
details of so many lives? She never treated us collectively. My
life would have been so different but for the time spent with her.
She prepared many for a sharp wrestle with life’s difficulties. And
how she remembered one’s home people too!</p>

<p class='c017'>“Such a wave of sadness comes over me as I think of her;
and yet, what a life hers was to rejoice over! So full and generous.
Hers was such a rich loving nature. Surely many, thinking of
what she has done, may indeed ‘take heart again!’ If I felt less,
I might be able to say more.”</p>

<p class='c005'>We could go on adding witness after witness in
those who have thus loved her. One thing only is more
wonderful than this general love, and that is the power
of loving to which it all came as response. It is by
putting together the impressions of complete satisfaction
given to each of these many varying needs, that
we finally reach some adequate estimate of this grand
personality. Each person in any relation to her, had
a special and real place in her regard, just as each child
has its own place in its mother’s heart—a place of its
very own. In this wide heart there was room for all,
and each distinct and distinctly separate. There was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>here no mere jumble of meaningless amiability. The
loves and the likings were quite definite. And possibly
the dislikings also; but of these no one heard very
much. Of hate and scorn there was none for anything
but evil itself. Her practice, like her teaching, was
“to be merciless to the sin, but very tender to the
sinner.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Almost more telling, in their intensity of regret, than
even these thanksgivings for the joy of such a friendship,
are the thoughts of one who was “glad just to
claim a place among the old pupils” in the crowded
church on that sad New Year’s Eve, when every heart
in the vast assembly beat in unison in the same love
and sorrow. During life there seemed always a vitalizing
principle in the influence of the leader thus mourned;
and who may measure the latent forces set free in this
great wave of feeling?—forces that might help to bring
about the hope of these first words—</p>

<p class='c014'>“As for the public loss, that is greater than we can understand,
because we shall never know how much she has done for women
till we know how much women will be able to do in the future.
But she helped more than women by what she did. She raised
the whole standard of life in raising the standard of women’s
education.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And then, in the light of this flash of insight into
the greatness of the work, comes a sense of personal
loss, in a lament which seems to bear with it the echo
of all the sighs of all the women of past ages, who
desired and aspired, but yet strove in vain, to break
the chains of ignorance that held them bound—chains
broken at length by this strong hand!</p>

<p class='c006'>How many a girl must have inwardly rebelled
against the deadening routine of the old conventional
schools, though so few had the strength by which this
once “timid child” won her own freedom. Measuring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>what have been by the force of that first never-forgotten
impression of the “vigorous intensity that swept her
up like a strong wind,” her words of regret that her
school-life had not been spent under that influence
come as among the saddest of the laments of that
sorrowful day—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Thinking it over after she was gone, a perfect agony of regret
came over me that I was not always her pupil. In church, that
day, the regret was so pregnant that it almost stupefied me....
When I think that Miss Buss was at our very doors, I can scarcely
bear to look back. Think of what I might have been saved—the
unutterable loneliness of those five years, the misery, the deliberate
fostering, of set purpose, of a morbid self-consciousness and self-distrust.
Why, I have never got over it! The deadening effect
of those five years clings to me still. I consider that it kept me
back fifteen years. Instead of leaving school broken-spirited and
irresolute, I should have had the inspiration of knowing that I had
been part of the great human movement. As it was, I had to grope
my way to modern thought.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I made very few friends at school, and shrunk from all. If
I had gone <i>there</i> I should have found a door open into the real
life I sought. But, above all, just think of exchanging Miss S——
for Miss Buss!—spontaneity for repression, an honest straightforward
ideal of duty, for a system based upon ‘Mason on Self-knowledge’!
(That book ought to be burnt by the common
hangman.)</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh, I thought some bitter thoughts as I sat that day among
the old pupils, thankful just to have the right to sit there at all!”</p>

<p class='c005'>There seems indeed good cause for regret that a
nature so sensitive should not have had full room for
unchecked growth in the warm sunny atmosphere of
this school, when the young teacher was free to throw
herself into the lives of her pupils. Freedom of growth—with
all the joy of such freedom—forms the great
wonder of those early days.</p>

<p class='c006'>The proof of the true vitality of this growth is in
the fact that these early pupils came themselves into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>possession of that power of impressing others which
was so distinctive of their teacher.</p>

<p class='c006'>I was very much struck by this fact when I first
heard of Miss Buss from one of these old pupils, Miss
L. Agnes Jones, who, though only for a few months
under her influence, never lost the impression either
of the teaching or of the teacher, so unlike all previous
experience. Years afterwards, the time for action found
her ready, and she became a potent factor in the first
stages of the change that has affected so many lives.</p>

<p class='c006'>All the “memories” from old pupils bear witness
to the same thing, put strongly by one who was afterwards
a member of her staff:—</p>

<p class='c014'>“She was to me a guide, a magnet, leading me on, higher and
higher, above all self-seeking, all petty vanities, all ignoble ambitions.... I
speak reverently when I say that her whole life seems
to me a sort of ladder or pulley to help us up nearer to the Perfect
Life lived on earth by our Great Model.”</p>

<p class='c005'>One example of this life giving influence may be
given, belonging to the early days when, through Miss
Jones, I also had come within its sphere, and felt its
fascination. Up to the day when, in a chance call on
one of us, she heard us talk of Miss Buss and her
work, Miss Fanny Franks had been quite content and
happy as a somewhat exceptionally successful daily
governess, appreciated by her pupils and their parents,
and taking just pride in the instruction given after her
own original fashion. She taught in this way for part
of five days a week, and, for the rest, lived a pleasant
girl-life at home with her sisters, all undisturbed by
educational theories.</p>

<p class='c006'>One flash of the new inspiration was enough to
change all this easy and happy experience into struggle
and effort. After the talk on that first day Miss Franks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>had gone straight to Miss Buss and offered her services.
“But, my dear, you have had no training! In these
days some credentials are necessary,” was the sufficiently
discouraging reply. But having now seen Miss Buss
for herself, there was no going back for the new adherent.
If training were necessary, training must be
had. At what cost is shown in her letter—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Having given up so much to this end, I should be sorry not
to go on. By ‘going on’ I mean the examination, and by ‘giving
up,’ leaving home and coming to live up here with only books for
seven or eight months. This examination and the hard study, and
the ill-health and spirits consequent thereupon, are the reasons
why I did not take an express-train to London immediately on
receipt of dear Miss Jones’  letter, which at any other time would
have gladdened me beyond expression. But it is all Miss Buss’
fault. She first inspired me with the idea of an examination. Had
it not been for her I should, in happy ignorance, have looked upon
myself as a good and capable teacher, not merely <i>in the making</i>—as
now—but ready and fit to do whatever she might propose.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Having been the cause of so decided a change, Miss
Buss was too loyal not to do all in her power to make
it a success. In her letters to me I find allusions during
the whole time which show her thoughtful consideration
of the best means to the end. She found a post in the
school, and lost no chance of fruitful suggestion. At
her wish Miss Franks attended Mr. Payne’s lectures, at
the College of Preceptors, on the Theory, History, and
Practice of Education, and no one was more pleased
when Miss Franks came out as an Associate of the
college. Again, when Miss Franks finally discovered
her true vocation, Miss Buss arranged to give her two
days a week for the Kindergarten experiments, now so
supreme a success.</p>

<p class='c006'>And now, being herself a leader, with her own band
of students taking a foremost place in the Kindergarten
movement, Miss Franks is only the more loyal to her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>own chosen leader, and among the many expressions of
loss come her pathetic words—</p>

<p class='c014'>“The sad time has come, and we have lost our wonderful
friend. Never will there be another Frances Buss! It makes me
ache to think of the faithful ones like Miss Begbie, and many
others, who have worked under her flag for so many years, and
have lost their splendid leader! Ah me! it is a sad time for
us all!”</p>

<p class='c015'>Just ten years after that picture of splendid vigour
which had so taken captive “the timid child of seven,”
we have a companion portrait in a not less lasting
impression made on a shy girl of seventeen, who after
the long lapse of years, thus recalls that first interview—</p>
<p class='c014'>“You ask me what it is which stands out most clearly in my
early recollections of our dear friend. It is nearly thirty-three
years since I saw her first, but I always remember her as I saw
her then. She was seated at her table (a round table) in what in
those days was always called ‘the parlour.’ It corresponded to
the ‘office’ of the present day, but with this difference, that Miss
Buss was always to be found there whenever she was not occupied
with her girls, in teaching or in superintending their work. She
was her own secretary, and we all became thoroughly accustomed
to seeing her writing there, but ready to lay aside her pen and give
her undivided attention to any one who needed it. Indeed, to the
best of my recollection, the door always stood partly open. I felt
there was something different about her from what I was accustomed
to observe in other women. There was such a mingling
of motherliness and sweetness with intense earnestness and
thoroughness about her work. She was at that time in deep
mourning. Her mother had died shortly before, and also the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Reverend David Laing, under whose wing she had begun, and for
several years carried on, her school. The double grief had been
felt very keenly, and she had been so ill that her hair was already
mingled with grey. I remember the way she dressed it—the front
hair being brought down over the ears, and the back rolled under
and covered with a black net. Her black dress was plainly
made, but fitted well. It was long, and made her look taller than
she was.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I felt attracted to her at once, and, as I got to know her, I
found that my first impressions were more than justified by
experience.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The change is very striking from the vivacious and
vigorous young head of the new school of 1850 and
this grave, kind woman of 1860, a change greater than
the mere lapse of time can justify. But the loss of her
mother, followed so closely by that of her friend Mr.
Laing, who had been the mainstay of all her school
career, must have been to her as the uprooting of her
very life. To the end she spoke of her mother with the
same deep tenderness. She had been friend as well as
mother, a double tie that meant so much as the daughter
grew to be the helper. Family claims took firm grasp
of this loyal nature, and the mother’s death meant also
taking her place to the father, left for the time helpless
without the all-pervading care that had stood between
him and all the minor miseries that loom so large to
the artist temperament.</p>

<p class='c006'>How this trust was fulfilled shows in the daughter’s
words when, fifteen years afterwards, this work of love
was ended.</p>

<div class='c024'>“Jan. 3, 1875.</div>

<p class='c017'>“On Saturday I go away with my father to Worthing. He
has been growing more and more feeble, and is a constant source
of anxiety. I feel that he needs me, and yet I cannot give up
more time to him than can be got on Sunday. But, you see, this
means Sunday as well as week-days. If you could peep in on
me it would be a pleasure to see your dear face. I think often of
you in my hurricane-speed life.”</p>

<div class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>“Feb. 11.</div>

<p class='c017'>“My father is still very ill. It looks as if he were fading away.
He is so patient, gentle, and loving to us all, and especially to me,
that I can scarcely keep up.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“Feb. 20.</div>

<p class='c017'>“My heart is wrung with grief. My dear, dear father is, we
believe, sinking. I am going now to him, and shall stay in the
house. He likes to have my hand in his, and to speak faintly from
time to time of my mother. He tells me I alone can soothe him
as she did. He is very peaceful, and suffering no pain, but he is
too weak to help himself in the least.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“Mar. 10.</div>

<p class='c017'>“I am so sorry to know you are again ill. It makes me
sigh. As soon as I can I will call, but I am almost breaking down
from nervous prostration.</p>

<p class='c017'>“My Liverpool journey, though likely to be useful, was trying.
It is full of my dear father.</p>

<p class='c017'>“You cannot imagine how large a blank he has left in my life.
Only time can fill it up. He was the one person to whom I was
necessary, and to whom my presence always carried pleasure, and
I cannot get into the way of remembering that he is not.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“Mar. 13.</div>

<p class='c017'>“I am not well. Some old symptoms have returned, though
not in a bad form. I can get through the day, but my evenings
and nights are distressing. I am in a sort of anguish which does
actually seem to affect my heart. Yet I would not recall my dear,
dear father if I could. But nature must have some expression, and
I really loved him. Besides, I was nearest to him and closest to
him! Many things we understand better now.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Knowing so well the power of a mother’s love, this
daughter had grown into that mother’s power of giving
herself out, a power that is universally felt as her chief
characteristic. Here is a description of her as she was
at the time when this portrait is drawn—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I think, in those early days, it was her sweet and motherly
way of drawing each one of us to her, and caring for each particular
person’s concerns, and remembering them, which impressed
me more than anything else, excepting indeed her very encouraging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>manner. She lost no opportunity of saying a loving word of praise,
and it would be accompanied by a motherly hug, which warmed
one’s heart for a long time. That comfortable, loving manner was
a great power among teachers and pupils. Many a girl who had
given trouble in one department or another, would go out of the
parlour, after a talk with Miss Buss, thoroughly softened and helped
into a right frame of mind.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This motherly kindness won the devotion of a
lifetime from the lonely girl so early called to face
the world, and Caroline Fawcett well earned her great
privilege of being one of the little band whose love
soothed the last hours of the friend who had been so
much in their lives. Her latest thought, as she writes
on that sad New Year’s Eve, is the same as the first of
so many years before—</p>

<p class='c014'>“But, indeed, it must be a great miss for us, the never being
able to go to her for motherly loving sympathy. One of the lights
that will go on shining out of her life, and will kindle others, is
that loving motherliness. If one could only show a little of it,
following in her dear footsteps!”</p>

<p class='c005'>This aspect of her character impressed even those
who had to do with Miss Buss outside her own work.
Mr. Garrod, secretary to the Teachers’ Guild, who
knew her in her public life, says of her: “To me she
seemed to be one who was born to shine as head of a
family, and to have the domestic rather than the public
excellencies.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Her school can fairly be regarded as her family, for
she may be said to have “mothered” them all—teachers
as well as pupils—even in the later days, when public
work took so much of her attention. Miss Emily
Hickey, one of the visiting professors, who came so
much less into contact with her than did the teaching
staff, puts this well, as she says of her intense “motherliness”—</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>“There is no other word for it. No one brought into any
emotional contact with her, could fail to realize this, and one can
see how much it must have had to do in binding so fast to her so
many women so much younger than she, both in years and in
experience.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Marks says also—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I remember when I saw her again some years afterwards,
and I remember how like a mother she seemed to me who wanted
a mother so dreadfully. Always after that I thought of her as a
sort of <i>universal mother</i>. There are few women like that!”</p>

<p class='c005'>On reading these words, a pupil of later years adds
to them—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I, too, wanted a mother, and found so much of what I wanted
in her. These might have been my own words, and are, indeed,
almost identical with what I have said.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And yet another—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have every reason to remember her with tender regard, and
to deeply regret her loss. From the fact that I was motherless,
she took an especial interest in my studies and health, making
my father and myself deeply grateful to her. I more than ever
feel what a friend I have lost. Camden Town is very lonely
without her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Marks continues—</p>

<p class='c014'>“And then the general impression of geniality and life which
was always so conspicuous! She was so <i>warm</i>, everything about
her was <i>infused with warmth</i>. There was no cold impersonality
in any of her thoughts. They were all alive. I need not say how
kind she was.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This kindness was all-inclusive, going down to the
least as well as rising to the highest. Among the
hundreds of letters of condolence received by Miss
Buss’ family was one from the firm which undertook
the charge of the school clocks, speaking strongly of
the kind and gracious way in which their <i>employés</i> had
always been treated.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>And there is a characteristic story of her in connection
with her old cabman Downes, who drove her,
year after year, to school and to church. On one
occasion, hurrying to catch the train to Cambridge,
Downes upset his cab, and Miss Buss was extricated
without having time to decide whether she was hurt or
not, her business being too important to admit of delay.
Her first act on reaching her destination was to telegraph
to Downes to assure him that she was not hurt.</p>

<p class='c006'>All records go to show how lasting was her interest
in all who made any claim on her, confirming the words
of another of her staff, when she says, “Girls, as soon
as they left school, felt that they had a friend ever
ready to sympathize with them in sorrow or in joy. A
happy marriage was a delight to her”—a remark confirmed
by a passage in one of Miss Buss’ letters, where
she says, “I wish Ada would bring Mr. Z—— to Myra.
I like to see my <i>sons-in-law</i>. He cannot be shyer than
Mr. Q——.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here is a note just after the opening of the new
buildings by the Prince and Princess of Wales, written
for the wedding-day of one of her pupils—</p>

<div class='c024'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Mary</span>,</div>
<p class='c025'>“Just a line to express my love and good wishes for
you and yours to-morrow.</p>

<p class='c017'>“May God bless you in your new state of life! I shall be with
you in spirit, and think of you all.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I hope you have received the little tea-table. The mats for it
have been delivered I know, but I am not sure about the table.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I hope Eleanor will send me a short note to say where you
have gone, and to give me some account of to-morrow’s ceremony.</p>

<p class='c017'>“With my dear love and good wishes,</p>
<p class='c030'>“Believe me, yours affectionately,</p>
<p class='c031'>“<span class='sc'>Frances M. Buss</span>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>To “meet the glad with joyful smiles” would always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>have been easy to her, but she was more often called
“to wipe the weeping eyes;” for the words of another
of the recent pupils was curiously true—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Of late years it has often struck me as melancholy that the
most successful and happiest of her old pupils, settled in homes of
their own, or teaching in schools at a distance, could do little more
than send an occasional letter, or pay a flying visit, while numbers
of the unsuccessful, the weak and helpless, came back to her for
the advice and help she never failed to give. Seeing, as she did,
numbers of these, she was very strongly impressed by the absolute
necessity for young girls to be trained to some employment by
which they might, if necessary, earn a livelihood. For women to
be dependent on brothers and relations, she considered an evil
to be avoided at all costs, and she tried to keep before us the fact
that training for any work must develop a woman’s intellect and
powers, and therefore make her—married or single—a better and
a nobler being.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Another friend adds on this point—</p>

<p class='c014'>“She was so kind and unprejudiced by unconventionality, that
she was just as interested and sympathetic and helpful towards an
old pupil, who came to her about trying to set up a business (such
as dressmaking or millinery), as she was to one going to Girton
or trying for a head-mistress-ship.”</p>

<p class='c005'>As instance of the thoroughness that characterized
her efforts to help the girls, one of them gives a little
experience which will come home to many a mother, as
she recalls the solicitude with which Miss Buss went
to any medical consultation needed by delicate girls
under her care—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I left school to become a governess myself, and during my
first holiday she made an opportunity for a quiet talk with me,
entering into all my plans and difficulties, and helping me greatly
by her wise and loving counsel. No effort was too great for her
to make, if she could thereby help or benefit any of us. Many
years later, when my sister had been under Dr. Playfair’s treatment,
he ordered her abroad, and she was to be accompanied by
a companion of whom he should approve. Miss Buss <i>not</i> only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>offered to let her join her party, shortly to start for Marienbad, but
<i>went</i> herself to see Dr. Playfair at eight a.m. (the only time she
was free during term-time), in order that he might be satisfied with
her as an escort. This meeting proved a mutual pleasure to them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It is pleasant to know that, out of this special
thoughtfulness, there came to Miss Buss, not only the
companionship in travel, but frequent resting in the
happy home of these girls; and also—a very great
satisfaction—the gift to the school of the “Crane
Scholarship,” to mark their mother’s appreciation of this
motherly care of her children.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the help given so kindly was by no means
limited to inspiration, instruction, or advice, carefully
and considerably as this might be thought out for each
separate case. Where the means of acting on her
suggestions were wanting her sympathy expressed
itself in more tangible terms. I remember, one day,
after discussing ways and means in some instance of
this sort, stopping short, and saying to her, “Do you
know <i>how many</i> girls you are helping at this moment?”
In the most matter-of-fact way she answered reflectively,
“Well, I could scarcely say, without going into the
question!” Occasionally she would ask help of some
one of a little band of friends willing to give it—often
of Miss Laura Soames—so soon to follow her—and of
Miss Edith Prance, and others. But more often than
not she said nothing about it, generally taking it on
herself. When the school had been her own this was
easy enough, but in a public school the fees must be paid
even by the head-mistress herself. She was, however,
free to please herself as to the help she gave at Myra
Lodge, and those who may have made calculations of
the income derived from the pupils there, might, if they
had known all, have found themselves far from accurate
in their sum total.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Here is a little story from far-away times, showing
not only her burdens, but that still rarer gift,
her unwavering steadfastness to an obligation once
taken up—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Among her friends was one family whose means were not in
full proportion to the large-heartedness which made the good
mother decide to keep as her own a little motherless baby, which
she had taken in during its mother’s fatal illness. Not only did
her own little daughters welcome the baby sister, but even the
over-worked father accepted without a murmur the sleepless nights
which were a small part of his contribution to the new-comer. As
soon as Miss Buss heard the story she said at once, ‘And I must
do my part. Her education shall be my care!’”</p>
<p class='c015'>—a care that lasted beyond school-days, and included
the finding of a fitting occupation for later life.</p>
<p class='c006'>Still another record may be added as typical of
so many more; a story none the less touching for the
humorous way in which it is told—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c032'>
    <div>“<span class='sc'>A Short Tribute from ‘A Lame Dog.’</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>“The work of ‘helping lame dogs over stiles’ is not recognized
publicly or read on the list amongst the various names of the good
works and societies with which our dear Miss Buss was connected,
and probably only the ‘Lame Dogs’ themselves know what a
kind strong hand helped them to climb the dreaded barrier; but
surely among the many thousands who call themselves ‘Old
North Londoners,’ or ‘Bussites,’ there is a long roll-call of such
silent work, deeply graven upon the hearts of those who, like myself,
<i>know</i>.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The first morning on which I took my place in the class-room
among several other new-comers introduced me individually to
Miss Buss, for on hearing my name mentioned she called me to
her and asked how it was spelt. This impressed me very much
at the time, as I was the only one upon whom this honour was
conferred, and my surname was hardly one to deserve special
attention.</p>

<p class='c017'>“As time went on, however, the little extra notice was sufficiently
explained, for I discovered that another family in the school bore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>a name nearly similar to my own, and indeed, throughout my
school-life, I was constantly being congratulated upon honours
never won, and credited with talents really possessed by the happy
bearer of the other name.</p>

<p class='c017'>“This incident doubtless might appear to be trivial and
insignificant to many, but to one nervously entering a new sphere
of life this was not so; from that moment I felt I was known to
the head-mistress as having a separate individuality, although
insignificant enough among so many.</p>

<p class='c017'>“A few years went on, and school-days passed happily enough,
without my having any special intercourse with Miss Buss, until,
owing to an unexpected crisis in affairs at home, it was suddenly
arranged for me to leave.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Then it was that I really began to know our dear head-mistress,
and to realize what she was to her girls, and how much
she cared individually for each one.</p>

<p class='c017'>“On a memorable morning for the second time she called me
out to have a chat with her, and fully discussed my future. She
pointed out the drudgery incumbent upon one who was only
inefficiently educated, and upon finding that my personal desire
was to have studied more thoroughly, she insisted most strongly
upon my remaining at school for another year.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I held no scholarship, neither, as affairs then stood, could I
receive any help from home.</p>

<p class='c017'>“All remonstrance was immediately swept aside. Miss Buss
offered to pay all school fees from her own pocket until I had
earned at least a matriculation certificate. She also insisted upon
my joining the gymnasium classes, which at that time were enjoyed
by those only who paid additional fees.</p>

<p class='c017'>“How could such kindness be refused? From that time work
was sacred, and as the terms flew by and the examination loomed
in the near future, <i>failure</i> became the one evil in the world most to
be dreaded. When the good news at last came out, and Miss
Buss, as excited over the result as the expectant candidates,
warmly congratulated us, she seemed to let each one know, in a
way peculiarly her own, what the pleasure or pain really meant to
her; to myself, having worked under high pressure, her silent
sympathy may be better understood than explained.</p>

<p class='c017'>“She trusted us so thoroughly.</p>

<p class='c017'>“My debt was never mentioned in any way by her, and it
was only on repaying the loan she told me she was glad to have
the money back, as she could then help others in a similar way.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>And there are so many who, like the writer of this
story, also <i>know</i>, though what they know is known to
themselves alone. But still, even from such vague hints
as have come to them, many intimate friends can echo
Eleanor Begbie’s exclamation, as she ended an interesting
talk about the early days, “No one will ever
know, on this side of the Day of Judgment, how many
girls owe all their education to Miss Buss!”</p>

<p class='c005'>My first remembrance of Miss Buss—dating from
October, 1870—is one that will come up very vividly to
all who remember her Tuesdays’ “at home,” at Myra
Lodge, and who will recall her gracious way of advancing,
with outstretched hand and welcoming smile,
to meet her friends.</p>

<p class='c006'>There was a touch of ceremoniousness in her reception
of strangers that made this smile seem all the
sweeter, dispelling a certain awe excited by the presence
and dignity, the sense of power and purpose, which were
there as the natural outcome of the habit of rule from
her childhood upwards. She was rather below than
above middle height, but she always gave an impression
of being taller than she was in reality.</p>

<p class='c006'>No one could be with her in any close relation
without speedily knowing how really kind she was, and,
after a very short acquaintance, it was quite easy to
believe the story that as Miss Buss made the announcement
of one of the first passes with honours, the delighted
student, in the exuberance of the joy at this success,
seized the dignified head-mistress, and whirled her round
in an impromptu waltz, ending without doubt in one
of those loving embraces which gave so much warmth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>to school-life; a warmth that carried her so happily
through so many long years of incessant strain.</p>

<p class='c006'>The heavy responsibilities and many cares of her
arduous life always made Miss Buss look older than
her years, even before she adopted the distinctive style
of dress which, though never out of the fashion, had
still a speciality of its own, which always made it seem
appropriate. She acted up to her theory that each
person should take pains to discover the style most
suitable, and then, having found it, should keep as near
to it as possible. This she herself did, contriving at
the same time to keep in touch with prevailing fashions.
Her gowns were always well made—for school and for
mornings of some strong serviceable black material,
with a simple collar and cap. For receptions, prize-days,
and evenings, she wore rich silk or satin, with
cap and <i>fichu</i> to match of real lace—her one cherished
“vanity.” She had a weakness for good lace, not forgotten
by her friends on anniversaries, so that she
acquired a good store of this valued possession. For
ornaments she did not care enough to buy them for
herself, though as gifts she appreciated them sufficiently.
It was a matter of principle with her that it is no less the
pleasure than the duty of every woman to make the
very best of her appearance; a duty especially incumbent
in those days on all who held any views which
could be called “advanced.” As Mrs. Marks says of
her, “there was about her an entire absence of peculiarity.
Never any one seemed less eccentric, and it
was impossible for the most rabid opponent of woman’s
rights to say that she was ‘unsexed.’”</p>

<p class='c006'>And just as she had a woman’s regard for her
appearance, she also cared about her house. The
drawing-room of 1870 was not yet what it was later—one
of the first finished specimens of decorative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>household art. That came years afterwards, with her full
success. But even before that era, though it might be
simple and old-fashioned, it was certain to be tasteful,
and as artistic as was then possible.</p>

<p class='c006'>In my very first talk with Miss Buss we touched
at once at the point on which she felt most deeply.
I had been interested in the question of employment
for women, having written some papers for the <i>Art
Journal</i> on the “Art-work Open to Women,” in which
I had come to the conclusion that here, as everywhere,
the chief obstacle to success lay in the want of education
and of training. A paper read by Dr. W. B. Hodgson
at the Social Science Congress, held in Newcastle-on-Tyne,
in 1870, followed by an able discussion, had
proved the connecting link between the question of
employment and that of higher education, and I then
recalled all I had heard from my friend Miss Jones about
Miss Buss’ schools and their new developments.</p>

<p class='c006'>After the Newcastle meeting I received the following
note from Miss Buss, which shows how things stood at
that date:—</p>

<div class='c024'>“12, Camden Street, Oct. 18, 1870.</div>

<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Madam</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“At Miss L. A. Jones’ request, I forward you four proofs
of our appeal. What we now want is funds.</p>

<p class='c017'>“As you will see, our list of subscriptions is very small. The
paper is as yet only a <i>proof</i>, because we cannot circulate largely
any statement, until the lease of the new house is actually signed.</p>

<p class='c017'>“When you return to town, I hope to have the pleasure of
seeing you. Agnes has often spoken of you to me, and I am glad
to know you are interested in our plans.</p>

<p class='c017'>“If we can get one school for girls well started, the ice will be
broken, and many others will be set up in imitation.</p>

<p class='c017'>“If you wish for further information, or for more copies of the
proof, I shall be glad to give you either.</p>
<p class='c033'>“Believe me,</p>
<p class='c034'>“Very truly yours,</p>
<p class='c030'>“<span class='sc'>Frances M. Buss</span>.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>Pleased as I was with this first communication from
one whom I had already learned to admire, I could
have no inkling of all it would mean for me in the
future, as the beginning of a friendship which steadily
deepened through the four and twenty years that followed;
a friendship which can only go on deepening
after we cease to count by days or years, since it is of
the kind not begun for any ending.</p>

<p class='c006'>As I left her that day the feeling of her life went
with me in my impression of the grief it had been to
her, just as her pupils began really to profit by her
teaching, to be compelled to give so many of them up.
Social reasons, family reasons, financial reasons, no
reason at all—anything, in those days, was sufficient
excuse for ending a girl’s education. But, nevertheless,
year by year, these same girls came back, under the
pressure of some unforeseen need, or even in the ordinary
course of things, as their fathers death broke up
the family, to ask their teacher’s advice how they might
gain a livelihood, and to rack her tender heart with the
hopelessness of their lot. Half-educated, wholly untrained,
what could they do? They could do nothing.
What she could do for them as individuals was utterly
inadequate, though she never failed to do whatever
might lie in her power. But each separate case that
came before her made her the more resolute to help
them, as a whole, by giving them the greatest good of
all—<i>a thorough education</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is quite in keeping that the crowning work of
her life should be the outcome of the passion of helpfulness,
in which this full mother-heart poured itself out.
She was a born educationalist, a teacher with the whole
bent of her nature, and she must in any case have
devoted herself to the task of making education a
science. But her great schools were the work not of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>her head, but of her heart, having their rise in her
feeling for the half-taught girls who were compelled to
teach for a livelihood. With her head she gave them
the instruction and training that would best help to
this end. Then with her heart she made the gift doubly
precious, since she gave them not merely the means of
living, but also a life worth living; they were fitted for
work, but, in the inspiration of her own life, she made
it work worth the doing; work that enriched the world
as well as the worker. It was her aim that teaching
should cease to be a mere trade—so many hours grudgingly
given for so much pay—and that it should take
its true place as foremost among the “learned professions,”
in which excellence of work, and not work’s
reward, is the object of ambition.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the time of her interview with the Commissioners
in 1865, the idea of making a public school for
girls had been growing in her thoughts, and, five years
later, several of her own personal friends who shared
her feeling agreed to form a trust to ensure the permanence
of the system worked out with so much care.</p>

<p class='c006'>The trust-deed was signed on July 26, 1870, by the
Rev. Charles Lee, who had succeeded the Rev. David
Laing, at Holy Trinity, and by Dr. M. A. Garvey and
Mr. W. Timbrell Elliott. The Rev. A. J. Buss, who
acted as honorary secretary, and the Rev. S. Buss were
also members of the Trust.</p>

<p class='c006'>During the ensuing week the number was increased
by the addition of Mrs. Wm. Burbury, Mr. T. Harries,
and Dr. Storrar, a member of the Schools Inquiry
Commission. During the next six months the Board
was increased by the election of Dr. Thorold, Mr. W.
Danson, Mrs. Offord, Miss Ewart, Miss Vincent Thompson,
and myself.</p>

<p class='c006'>Translated into plain fact, this trust-deed represents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>the transfer by Miss Buss to the public of the results
of twenty years’ labour. The school was her own
property, being merely under friendly supervision from
the St. Pancras’ clergy. The income was at her own
disposal, and out of school she was free to cultivate all
the refined tastes with which she was so richly endowed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Until 1866 Miss Buss had remained with her father
in Camden Street, making no change in her life since
her girlhood, and not even having a banking account
of her own. It had not occurred to any one that in
making the money she had any special right to it.</p>

<p class='c006'>In this year it became desirable for her health that
she should live away from the school, and as Mr. Buss
could not be induced to remove from Camden Street,
he remained there, in the care of a relative, while Miss
Buss went for a time to Mr. and Mrs. Septimus Buss,
in Maitland Park. But in 1868 it seemed necessary to
prepare for the coming changes, and she then took
Myra Lodge, to which she removed the boarders who
had been under her supervision, though in the charge
of Miss Mary Buss and Miss Fawcett, at 15, Camden
Street. She had to be prepared with some alternative
in case of failure; for on all sides she was warned against
a venture so rash as to be almost hopeless. Who was
likely to send girls to a “public school”? To make the
experiment meant that the old school—the work of
so many years, and now a splendid success—must go.
What, then, would be left?</p>

<p class='c006'>Success would mean the realization of the desire of
her life—that success which came at last after nine years
of effort—success beyond all hope. But in 1870 the
experiment was more than doubtful, and the chance
of failure had to be boldly faced. She did not hesitate,
and gave herself to the labour of the new organization,
with its anxiety, struggles, and all the chances of failure.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>After having been all her life her own mistress, she put
herself under rule, and in addition to the loss of personal
freedom, she risked a present certainty, and the prospect
of future affluence, to accept for the next three years
a greatly diminished income with doubled or trebled
work; giving up at the same time assured honour and
widespread reputation for misunderstanding, suffering,
and disappointment.</p>

<p class='c006'>A letter written at the close of 1871, after a year of
struggle, shows how keenly she could feel these things—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am beginning to feel very hard and bitter. Were it not for
that Anchor to which alone one can cling, I should sometimes
lose all hope and faith. One gentleman, who can well afford £5,
who is largely mixed up with education, responds, in answer to an
appeal for that small sum, ‘Let Miss Buss do it; she has been
making heaps of money for years’! This is the general view, and
is one reason why I told you my name did no good, but rather the
reverse. At any time within the last ten years, having even then
a large connection and some reputation, I <i>could</i> have  ‘made
money;’ but how? By taking a grand house, a small number of
‘select’ pupils, offering fashionable accomplishments, and asking
high terms. In that case there would have been little work and
plenty of money! Even now, if I cut myself off from the public
schools, and lived in Myra Lodge, devoting myself to twenty pupils,
I could ‘make’ a good income, and live the life of an independent
lady!</p>

<p class='c017'>“But as I have grown older the terrible sufferings of the women
of my own class, for want of good elementary training, have more
than ever intensified my earnest desire to lighten, ever so little, the
misery of women, brought up ‘to be married and taken care of,’
and left alone in the world destitute. It is impossible for words
to express my fixed determination of alleviating this evil—even to
the small extent of one neighbourhood only—were it only possible.
If I could do without salary I would; but it is literally true—although
this is of course to <i>you</i> only—that I have to earn about £350 or
£400 per annum before there is anything for my own expenditure.
This house has been a great burden, but I hope it will pay in
time; I could not have surrendered the other place if I had not
had this, and that is why I undertook it.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>“You see I, too, am growing very confidential!</p>

<p class='c017'>“What work can do I have honestly tried to do. Money I
have never had to give, and if I had earned money as mentioned,
I should never have had the experience of numbers and consequent
sympathy.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Pray destroy this note, and bury its contents in silence. You
can never know how much hope you have given me, as well as
practical help.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Expecting that I should in the future write the story
of this work, I thought myself justified in not obeying
this request, as now in breaking the silence of four and
twenty years.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Buss began to work at eighteen, and worked
till she was sixty-eight, and she was one of the most
successful women of her time; but surprise is expressed
that she could leave behind her the sum of £18,000.
Considering that her personal wants were very few, and
that for nearly twenty years she had £1300 a year from
the school (£100 a year and capitation fees) and from
Myra Lodge not less than £2500, the wonder rather is
that she did not leave a great deal more. It is evident
that she must have spent largely, and it is certain that
this expenditure was not on herself.</p>

<p class='c006'>As a point of principle—that good work should
receive good pay—the salaries in the Upper School are
higher than in most schools.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c018'><sup>[5]</sup></a> As a matter of principle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>also Miss Buss thought it right to make provision for
old age, as she did not mean to accept the pension
which would have been offered. And considering what
she had been having, as well as the accumulated claims
of her generous life, this provision can surely not be
called extravagant.</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f5'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r5'>5</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Some time ago I had occasion, on behalf of a joint committee of
head-mistresses and assistants of which I was a member, to make a careful
inquiry into the salaries of assistants, in the girls’ public day schools, both
endowed and proprietary. In the course of this inquiry it came out that
the North London Collegiate School <i>is able to afford</i>, and does pay a higher
average salary than any other of those from which we obtained statistics....
The Camden School also held its own, with salaries well above the
means of those obtaining in schools of its type.</p>

<p class='c020'>“I agree in desiring the average salary to be much higher than it is for
assistant-mistresses and assistant-masters too. But I claim for the great
leader who has passed from amongst us, that in this matter she has given
the true lead.”—Letter from Mrs. Bryant, <i>Educational Times</i>, March, 1895.</p>
</div>

<p class='c006'>But in 1870 she had not begun to save on any large
scale. And for the next three years her gifts to the
new movement were out of all proportion to her receipts,
while she was credited with the possession of means that
were non-existent, as well as with a salary which she
declined to take, knowing that the money was needed
for working expenses.</p>

<p class='c006'>Myra Lodge, though at first an anxiety, was before
long not merely a success, but also a help to the
school. In a note written at the end of 1873 Miss
Buss remarks—</p>

<p class='c014'>“It seems that I have paid from Myra, <i>in fees</i> (paid by her for
her boarders), just about £850 in these three years: £200, £232,
and £410, and I have received in all (from the school) £1600. So
your head-mistress has not been a costly article!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Counting the value of furniture, as well as the
balance of salary not accepted, Miss Buss gave during
this period not less than £1000, besides paying the
£850 in fees from Myra. After the removal of the
Upper School from 202, Camden Road, as the lease
was still in her possession, she supervised a Preparatory
School, the profits of which—£1500 in all—she handed
over to the governing body, thus supplying funds for
the gymnasium. Nor was this all; she made in addition
to these gifts several very helpful loans, without
which the work must have come to a standstill. Early
in 1873 an entry on the minutes records the thanks of
the Governors—</p>

<p class='c014'>“The Board wish to record their strong sense of the generosity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>and public spirit shown by Miss Buss, when she last year pressed
the Board to take on mortgage the ground and building in Sandall
Road, for the enlargement of the North London Collegiate School,
and when, in March last, she proposed that a considerable sum
should be laid out in enlarging the building in Sandall Road;
Miss Buss in both cases sacrificing the additional income which
would have been hers, and undertaking at the same time still
greater responsibility and harder work.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Under the new scheme Miss Buss’ own school
remained as the Upper School, but was removed to
202, Camden Road, leaving the former premises in
Camden Street, with most of the furniture and “school
plant,” for the new Lower School, of which the fees
were fixed at £4 4<i>s.</i> per annum, for a thorough education
up to the age of sixteen years.</p>

<p class='c006'>All the provisions of the scheme were in accordance
with those proposed by the Endowed Schools Commission,
and it was intended that the fees should meet
only the working expenses, the buildings being supplied
by some endowment. For the Lower, or Camden
School, the sum of £5000 was considered sufficient, and
it was not unnaturally imagined that this moderate
amount might be supplied by the same generous public
which had given £60,000 for a similar school for boys.
For the Upper School only £1000 was asked to supply
the furniture left behind in Camden Street, for the use
of the Lower School.</p>

<p class='c006'>In September, 1871, Miss Buss says of the Camden
School—</p>

<p class='c014'>“No furniture has been paid for at all; the school is poorly
supplied, and the teachers are badly paid. Instead of being rent
free, we pay £115 per annum, and rates, amounting at least to
£20 more.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It is clear to me that all such schools need—First, to be
rent free; second, to have an endowment, largish or small, to
keep the buildings in repair and to offer scholarships; third, to
have all the school furniture and fittings given. Then, but not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>till then, can the teachers be fairly paid, and the trustees free from
anxiety. For such a purpose, I imagine five or six thousand
pounds are wanted—say, £4000 for building, £1000 for furniture,
apparatus, and the rest for repairs, etc.</p>

<p class='c017'>“For the Higher School the same kind of thing is wanted, only
on a more extensive scale, as furniture and fittings must be more
expensive. The higher fees would still be required to meet the
demand for higher teaching. According to my notions, gymnasiums
are needed for every school, and large places for swimming.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But at the first start how natural it seemed to expect
the small amount of help which should do so much!
“What we now want is funds!” And those very
modest sums then formed the total of this requirement.
She asked no more for the fulfilment of that early dream,
“I want girls educated to match their brothers.” Everything
was there except the funds. The educational
system had been tested by experience and stamped by
success; the teacher, fitted at all points, was ready for
work. Friends were ready with time and thought to
help in carrying out the work. Having thus all the
important essentials, who could doubt that the rest must
follow?</p>

<p class='c006'>In our own enthusiasm for Miss Buss and her work
it seemed to Miss Jones and to me that all that was
needed was to make the case known. We were both
accustomed to the use of our pens, and placed ourselves
at Miss Buss’ service, beginning first by an appeal to
our own personal friends, with enough of success at the
outset to justify our going on. But we soon discovered
that beyond this range things were of a different order.</p>

<p class='c006'>I had seen so much of the kindness shown by Mr.
and Mrs. S. C. Hall to all sorts of philanthropic effort
that I fully counted on their help. In addition to the
<i>Art Journal</i>, Mr. Hall was editor of <i>Social Notes</i>, and
Mrs. Hall had not given up the <i>St. James’ Magazine</i>;
so that we saw here our way to a wider public.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>The reply to my appeal seems worth giving <i>in
extenso</i>, as a measure of the public opinion of that day.
If a woman who had made her own mark on the world
in ways out of the beaten track, could so write, what
must have been the feeling of the average woman, to
say nothing of the narrowminded and ignorant? Mrs.
Hall was, besides, amongst the foremost who showed
interest in higher education in being one of the earliest
of the lady-visitors at Queen’s College.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here is the letter—</p>

<div class='c024'>“15, Ashley Place, Oct. 31, 1870.</div>

<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>My dear Annie</span>,</p>

of <i>life</i> is carried on. Do you want to educate girls in the ‘arts’
as practised in the Universities?</p>

<p class='c017'>“I have no fault to find with the arrangements of the <i>Lower</i>
School, except its incompetence to provide the means which will
enable women to exist. They should be taught trades—painting
on glass and china; hair-weaving; certain branches of watchmaking
(as abroad); confectionery; <i>cooking</i>—each half-dozen
going into training for this at least once a week; clear-starching;—<i>trades</i>,
in fact. When I was a girl I went down once a week into
the housekeeper’s room to see how jellies and blanc-mange, soups,
and pastry were made; to learn the quantities <i>and help to do all
she did</i>.</p>

<p class='c017'>“This did not prevent my accomplishments going on; or my
riding and enjoying all the amusements a country girl could have.</p>

<p class='c017'>“If a revolution came I know I could have found pupils to
teach French and music to. I could have made a good nurse,
or housekeeper, or clear-starcher.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>“I would also have every boy and girl learn the Latin grammar
first, or at the same time as the English. In law-copying, for
instance, which young women should be trained in later, knowledge
of Latin is invaluable.</p>

<p class='c017'>“No; dear Mrs. Laing never told me of Miss Buss’ new plans.
She is really so good and right-thinking a woman that I wonder
how she would give the sanction of her practical name to any plan
embracing ‘College Examinations,’ by way of making women
useful or bread-earning members of society. Better, more useful
education in what can be more practically useful, without being
unsexed, is what they want, but are not likely to get while such
women as Emily Faithfull lead the van.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I saw some time ago you were restless and uncertain on the
question of Woman’s Rights, which might almost be defined as
Man’s Wrongs. <i>Your</i> head would work you up at one of the
Cambridge Examinations, and now and then work up a clever
woman, but what good was to arise from that if a revolution came
I cannot understand!</p>

<p class='c017'>“I should, indeed, be astonished if your father ‘went in’ for
College Examinations for girls!</p>

<p class='c017'>“I hope you will not endeavour to enlist X——’s sympathies in
College Examinations for women. Dear darling! any strong-minded
notions would be a source of trial to her admirable
husband, and do her no good.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am sorry you have taken up this matter.</p>
<p class='c030'>“Yours sincerely,</p>
<p class='c031'>“<span class='sc'>A. M. Hall</span>.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I shall have a great deal more to say on this matter hereafter,
if I live.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This letter was as discouraging as it was unexpected.
But I bided my time. Happily, Miss Jones had succeeded
better. She not only received a donation of
£30 from Miss Caroline Haddon, but Mrs. Offord, Miss
Haddon’s sister, became a member of the Board, and
by her practical knowledge gave a sympathy most
helpful to Miss Buss. Hearty adherence had also been
secured from Mr. E. C. Robins, a successful architect,
who made schools his <i>spécialité</i>. Both Mr. and Mrs.
Robins proved valuable friends to Miss Buss’ work, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>they have since done to the Hampstead High School,
to the New Technical Schools, and the Hampstead
Branch of the Parents’ Union, started by themselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Robins first of all demanded a personal statement
of her needs from Miss Buss, as he said—</p>

<p class='c014'>“We are interested in <i>her</i>; in <i>her</i> experience; in <i>her</i> aspirations;—we
want to know her ultimate aims. We want a sketch
contrasting what is provided for middle-class boys with what is
provided for middle-class girls; also how this particular scheme is
likely to effect the desired result.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This paper was accordingly drawn up, with Miss
Buss, Mrs. Robins, Miss Jones, and myself as honorary
secretaries, and we confidently expected to get the
£1000 which was then the modest limit of our hopes.</p>

<p class='c006'>Soon after this all the friends of the movement
were gathered together at a drawing-room meeting at
Myra Lodge, that they might see Miss Buss, and hear
from herself of her plans. Her notes at this time are
in curious contrast with those written nine years after
in the height of her fame—</p>

<div class='c024'>“Nov. 20, 1870.</div>
<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>My dear Miss Ridley</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“Many thanks for your note; you have worked hard
and successfully. I have invited several people, but as yet the
number of acceptances only amount to fourteen.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Mrs. De Morgan is interesting people in one plan.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I hardly think we ought to ask Miss Garrett just <i>now</i>; she is
almost worn out with meetings, having been obliged to attend two
and even three a day, since the election excitement began.</p>

<p class='c017'>“My notion is to get a mixed meeting, in Camden Street, the
week after next, and then we can have speeches from the gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am hopeful about next Wednesday’s meeting; the thing is
to interest women, and to convince some of them of the necessity
of schools for girls. Then to answer as far as possible any objections
so that they may be armed to meet them.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>“I have to go to a Council meeting in Queen’s Square, so am
rather hurried.</p>
<p class='c030'>“Yours sincerely,</p>
<p class='c031'>“<span class='sc'>Frances M. Buss</span>.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“Myra Lodge, Dec. 1, 1870.</div>

<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Agnes</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“Will you and Miss Ridley make up a list of the names
and addresses of the ladies present at our meeting yesterday?
Your lists and mine will probably complete the number.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Were you content? I thought it a great success to have so
many ladies. Including everyone, there must have been forty-two
or forty-three.</p>

<p class='c017'>“There had been a meeting of trustees yesterday, when it was
decided that we should hold a parents’ meeting at Camden Street
next week, and a public meeting in the Vestry Hall the week
after. That is why I could not announce a meeting for next
week.</p>

<p class='c017'>“With love and best thanks,</p>
<p class='c030'>“I am, yours affectionately,</p>
<p class='c031'>“<span class='sc'>Frances M. Buss</span>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Certainly the thing then needed was “to interest
women” generally in the subject. There were, of
course, a certain number of women deeply interested in
everything relating to the status of women, educational
or political. But at that special time these two groups
were fully occupied, the one with Miss Davies’ new
venture at Hitchin, and the other with Miss Garrett’s
election on the School Board. These two ladies themselves
took full interest in Miss Buss’ plans, as she did
in theirs. But they all needed funds from the outside
public, and demand and supply were far from being
equal.</p>

<p class='c006'>Public opinion in 1870 was very much what it had
been in 1849, and to most persons the stir about improved
education for women seemed very unnecessary.
Most women were quite satisfied with their own girls,
and did not trouble about the rest; and till women
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>cared about the subject, it could scarcely be expected
that men would rouse themselves. Thus, out of London’s
millions those really concerned in this question might
be counted by hundreds, and persons who for objects
that really interested them would give hundreds, or
even thousands, thought themselves very generous if
they gave units or tens to the new movement.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nothing could show more clearly the indifference of
the public to higher education than the insignificance
of the details of the work of the next two years. They
may, however, be worth noting, on the principle on
which the mother treasures the baby-shoes once belonging
to the strong man, who, since those first uncertain
efforts, has left deep “footprints in the sands of time.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The year 1870 ended with what was then a very
great and important event—one of the very first public
meetings concerning the education of girls—held at the
St. Pancras Vestry Hall, under the presidency of Lord
Lyttelton. Very considerable interest seemed to be
excited in the larger world outside the immediate circle
of friends, and hopes rose. One important practical
issue came immediately in the addition to the governing
body of the Rev. A. W. Thorold, Vicar of St. Pancras
(afterwards Bishop of Rochester and of Winchester).
Both in his official capacity, and as having been a
member of the Schools Inquiry Commission, Dr. Thorold
was a most valuable supporter of the work.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>With the success of this first public meeting, it was
hoped that the tide had turned. On February 15, 1871,
a drawing-room meeting at the house of Mr. E. C. Robins
gave still further encouragement. I had prepared a
paper, entitled “Pearl and Sea-foam,” contrasting the
solid work of the education given to boys with the
evanescent glitter of that thought to be sufficient for
girls, and giving an account of Miss Buss’ work and
aims.</p>
<p class='c006'>A good discussion followed, in which many persons
interested in education took part. The immediate
result was the active adhesion of Mr. John Neate, who
undertook to interest some of the City Companies.
This was a real advance. Hitherto there had been a
general agreement that “something ought to be done,”
and that “somebody ought to do it;” but it was also
generally agreed that “somebody else” was responsible
for action in the matter, and we had not yet found this
very essential personage. The discovery was now made
that in the City Companies, which had done so much for
boys, we should without doubt find all that could be
desired.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>The prospect did indeed seem hopeful. We had
already on our own governing body a member of the
Merchant Taylors’ Company in Mr. W. Timbrell Elliott.
Our new friends, Mr. Robins and Mr. Neate, belonged
to the Dyers’ and the Clothworkers’ Companies, and
all three gentlemen became, within a short time, the
Masters of their respective Companies. We had, however,
to wait quite till the end of the year before the
first large donation of £100 from the Fishmongers’
Company set the example, afterwards followed by the
Brewers’ and the Clothworkers’ Companies in the gift
of the school-buildings.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Robins printed the first copies of “Pearl and
Sea-foam,” which were found useful in our next effort
to secure £500 in £5 donations, for the barely necessary
furniture in the two schools. Miss Buss had left the
greater part of her furniture in Camden Street, and had
gone to an empty building at 202, Camden Road; but
about this time she writes—</p>

<p class='c014'>“If we could raise £500 in addition to what we have, I think
we might, for the present, let the North London Collegiate School
go on alone.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The first thing next term will be to apply to City Companies
for the <i>Camden</i> School.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am very busy, as you can guess, and you will not mind this
work.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I could send such a statement to some people, I think. But
I would suggest that the whole trouble should fall on you, by your
giving your name and address as Hon. Sec., or receiver, or anything
you like. Any names I obtained I would send to you.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“March 23.</div>

<p class='c017'>“What a very nice woman that Australian lady must be!
Somehow I have been in a depressed or out-of-tune condition all
day, and now—faithless that I am—your note comes to cheer me
up and give me fresh hope. How wonderful is the all-prevailing
law of compensation! Sunshine and shade vary our days.”</p>

<div class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>“March 27.</div>

<p class='c017'>“The City people are not to be moved to do anything that is not
in the City. Honour and glory follow there, so there they will work.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Mr. Rogers is about to open his school, and when it is done,
it will be published, with a flourish of trumpets, ‘See what the City
does! It inaugurates a new era,’ etc. But, after all, what matters
it if the work is done?</p>

<p class='c017'>“Mr. Rogers has already been attacked, I assure you. I went
straight off to Mr. Jowett, some time since, to strengthen him, if
necessary, by arguments in behalf of girls.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Miss Davies helps me as much as she can, but her energies,
interests, hopes are all centred in the <i>College</i>. She cannot well
beg for two different things at one time, and it is for this reason
that she is not one of our trustees.</p>

<p class='c017'>“There are three City men who have in their hands a capital
sum of £30,000—half of this is to be spent on <i>a</i> girls’ school in
the City.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Nothing but an organized opposition through the Charity
Commission will make them do anything else. £15,000 on <i>one</i>
school, and that in the City, where it is not wanted, especially if
Mr. Rogers’ school be opened! I mean to try and get a grant out
of them—they have given three grants, each of a thousand, to
Mr. Rogers—but, you will see, they will give another thousand to
him for his girls’ school, and they will give nothing to us, because
we are <i>not</i> in the City.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Here we begin with nothing—in the Camden School, at all
events. We must work on and get publicity, then we may get
money.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“March 27, 1871.</div>

<p class='c017'>“Mrs. Grey’s letter came to-day. You will see that her paper
may help us a little, but not very much. I have no idea as to an
‘advocate.’ Dr. Hodgson is at Bournemouth—Mr. Cooke Taylor
I know nothing of—Mr. Lee is the only person I can think of now,
and there are several reasons against asking him. Between now
and the 31st could we not get some one to pay us a visit and speak
up for us?</p>

<p class='c017'>“I will send Mrs. Grey your paper, but I rather think she had
a copy.</p>

<p class='c017'>“My holiday trip was delightful....</p>

<p class='c017'>“Will you tell me when we meet whether you would consent

<p class='c017'>“How brave and earnest you are! It is such a comfort to me!
You can have no idea of what work and worry I have to face, and
almost single-handed.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Please accept my proposal to become a trustee. Your help
will be invaluable to me and to the Cause, and, as a trustee, you
can say and do much more for us.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Let me know if you accept.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“May 23, 1871.</div>

<p class='c017'>“I want to see you very much. You were unanimously elected
a member of our Board yesterday, and were also, at <i>my</i> request,
put on the Memorial Committee, which is to deal with the question
of applications for money from Companies, etc.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I have written to ever so many people, but have no more
names. We have got a list of the Companies, of their clerks, of
their styles,  ‘Worshipful,’ etc.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The £5 collection was well received yesterday when I mentioned
it at our meeting, and the list has gone to the printer. I
am really quite hopeful about it.</p>

<p class='c017'>“There are 112 girls in the Camden Schools now, and I want
you to write, if you can, to Irwin Cocks, Esq. (or Cox?), editor of
the <i>Queen</i>, 346, Strand, stating what we are doing, how we have
started this school, etc. He would probably insert it, and then a
friend, Miss Chessar, would write a short leader about it. It
seems rather too bad to trouble you, but I really am too overdone
with the inner work of the two schools to be able to do much in
the outer work.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Mrs. Laing will put our papers into Mrs. Craik’s hands,
<i>to-morrow</i>—D. M. Muloch, I mean.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Can you tell me for certain what is Sir John Bowring’s
Company? We must begin with that.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Lady Bowring had gone over the schools with me,
and, like all who saw them, was charmed with her visit.
She had promised to secure Sir John Bowring’s interest
with his own Company and with the Gilchrist Trust.
From the latter help came in scholarships.</p>

<p class='c006'>But of the uses of “Pearl and Sea-foam” none
gave me so much satisfaction as this letter from Mrs.
S. C. Hall—</p>

<div class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>“April 6, 1871.</div>
<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>My dear Annie</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“If it please God to prolong my days and my ability to
work, <i>after</i> I have been able, by my exertions, to add a small
additional ward to the Great Northern Hospital, my <i>present</i> impression
is that I should like to help the educational plan of Miss
Buss. But I never could devote my heart to two things at once,
and that Great Northern Hospital is what I shall work and beg
for—and nothing else—during the next year. I hate bazaars, but
there is no other way that I know of to get the necessary funds—except
a concert—and, at present, I can only grope my way.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Mr. Ruskin has not been here since Christmas, but I can say
anything to him, now that I know him so well; and, <i>after</i> I have
had some hospital talk with him, I will give him your ‘Foam,’ and
ask him to see Miss Buss’ schools.</p>

<p class='c017'>“He is most charming. It always does my heart good to see
him playing with the dogs on the hearthrug. Oxford takes up a
good deal of his time. Miss Hill looks after his cottages. Dear
little Joan Agnew is to be married this month. I am so glad she
is to live at Denmark Hill. She is such a lovely darling.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am very glad Mr. Hall suggested that art work to you;
only don’t make yourself ill over it.</p>

<p class='c017'>“With warm regards to all,</p>
<p class='c030'>“Your affectionate friend,</p>
<p class='c031'>“A. M. H.”</p>

<p class='c005'>After Mrs. S. C. Hall’s first letter I had met at her
house both Mrs. Laing and the Rev. T. Pelham Dale,
friends of Miss Buss, who warmly took her part. After
much effort, Mrs. Hall and Miss Buss met at last, being
mutually attracted.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some extracts from Miss Buss’ letters at this time
show how very busy she was—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mrs. S. C. Hall and I have not converted each other yet.
Why? Because she was not well, and I did not go!”</p>

<p class='c005'>And later—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mrs. Hall asked me yesterday to go to lunch with her to-morrow.
But, most unfortunately, I had engaged a railway
carriage to take the girls in my house to Windsor, and cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>possibly send them without me. I could go to-morrow afternoon,
but I have a meeting of my Dorcas Committee, followed by a
teachers’ meeting. Both these must be given up if I go to Mrs.
S. C. Hall’s, and, as you have already met this Indian gentleman,
it seems scarcely worth while, either for you or me.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am glad Mrs. Hall is being led to see that a woman may
have cultivation, and yet be able to mend a glove. <i>Why</i> people
should insist on thinking that the education which should make a
man must be injurious to a woman, is, to me, perplexing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Though Mrs. S. C. Hall declined to beg for us
herself, she did very good service in introducing Miss
Geraldine Jewsbury, who threw herself heart and soul
into the work, bringing many useful friends, and, above
all, by her own bright, breezy nature, cheering Miss Buss
in many an hour when hope was low.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Miss Jewsbury has raised again some hope—only I fear she
has not had so much experience as you and I, in asking and
failing. She is quite charming.</p>

<div class='c024'>“Monday.</div>

<p class='c017'>“These suggestions of Mr. Robins’ have been carried out, as
you see. By to-morrow night, every <i>member</i> of every <i>court</i> of
every <i>Company</i> will have had an invite to Friday’s meeting, and a
circular of the Camden Schools.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I have asked Miss Cobbe to help us to publicity, and Mr.
Edwin H. Abbott, of the City of London School, will speak. I
will see about Mr. Bompas.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Invitations have been sent to every parent in both schools;
have been left at every house in the High Street.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I have bought twenty-eight prizes, have ordered <i>labels</i> to put
inside, have harangued the Camden girls, have divided all <i>my</i>
girls, and have had a dreadful day’s work. But one hopes on,
and I have been for years accustomed to find ‘after many days.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>At the prize-giving of the Camden School the
Lord Mayor (Sir T. Dakin) took the chair, and there
were present the Lady Mayoress, Mrs. Laing, Mrs.
Burbury, Miss Emily Davies, the Rev. Edwin Abbott,
Mr. Fitch, Mr. Joseph Payne, and other friends of
Higher Education. Dr. Abbott, head-master of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>City of London School, spoke very strongly on the
duty of the Mayor and Corporation to provide for girls
schools similar to those of their brothers.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the following day Lord Dartmouth presided
over the meeting for the Upper School, also held at
St. George’s Hall, Langham Place, at which Harvey
Lewis, Esq., M.P., and Arthur Roebuck, Esq., M.P.,
Mrs. Grey, Miss Jewsbury, Mrs. Henry Kingsley, and
many others, were present.</p>

<p class='c006'>A few days after the meetings, Miss Buss writes—</p>

<p class='c014'>“We are <i>agitating</i> beautifully. Dr. Storrar read me a
private, but very encouraging note from Lord Lyttelton, saying
that we should have some endowments as soon as they can lay
their hands on any.</p>

<p class='c017'>“This will probably be very useful to us. As Mr. Robins
says, our school must be the first of a series, encircling the
City. Boys go immense distances to the City schools, showing it
would be better, physically and morally, to have the schools
within reach of the parents. Constant railway travelling is bad
for growing lads, and there is no telling the amount of moral
injury from companions in railway carriages, of whom the parents
know nothing.</p>

<p class='c017'>“This cannot be tolerated for <i>girls</i>!...</p>

<p class='c017'>“Do you smile inwardly at our getting the start? Whether
successful or not, we are first in the field, anyway, even in the
City. I feel quite lighthearted because—you will not guess—but
Mr. Danson has been at work over the accounts, all day yesterday
and all day to-day. He is so thoroughly business-like, and so
good-natured and patient, that it is a sensible relief to me. He
has time and knowledge, and is willing to devote both as his share
of work.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I think we shall leave London, by the night mail, on Friday
in time to catch the Hull boat to Gottenburg, which starts at six
a.m. on Saturday.</p>

<p class='c017'>“As I am always very sea-sick, the rest I so much want will
be got on board by means of being compelled to be still.</p>

<p class='c017'>“My beginning of that last sentence wants an explanation, I
see, so now you have it. Collapse comes on, in a mild form, after
weeks of work, at the rate of fifteen hours <i>per diem</i>. I trust by
the time we reach Gottenburg to have recovered.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>“Mr. Robins asked me to the Swan-hopping dinner; but as
it is on the 7th, I must not give up a week’s holiday for it. So
Mr. Lee is going to advocate our cause privately as opportunity
serves.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Mr. Elliott has invited me to the Merchant Taylors’ dinner,
on Thursday next, in the Crystal Palace. To that I am going;
more, however, from policy than from inclination, as it is very
possible I shall have to sit up best part of the night to pack for
my journey, and put away all other things until my return.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Did it ever occur to you that packing, etc., or indeed, anything
peculiarly womanly, is difficult, almost impossible to a
woman who leaves home, day after day, at 8.30, and does not
return, often—well, sometimes till 10.30 at night? That is my
programme lately. But how much I talk of myself....</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am obliged to break off hastily. I have been waiting at
Myra Lodge for visitors who have not come! <i>Quel bonheur!</i>”</p>

<div class='c024'>“July 24, 1871.</div>

<p class='c017'>“This morning Mr. Lee and I met Dr. Storrar and Mr. Robins
at the Mansion House. The Lord Mayor spoke most pleasantly
to us. He will give us a note, which Mr. Lee proposes to have
lithographed, and a copy of this will accompany every memorial.
The Lord Mayor was particularly agreeable to me, and congratulated
me warmly; he is very much interested indeed, and
hopes to pay us a visit in working hours early next term. At all
events, the Lady Mayoress will come—we must keep her up to it.
The census shows a <i>steady decrease</i> in residents in the City!”</p>

<div class='c024'>“July 27, 1871.</div>

<p class='c017'>“Pray read the attack on us in to-day’s <i>Times</i>. The fight has
begun. We are not really in opposition. Any school in the City
opened by Mr. Rogers will not prevent the necessity of a Camden
Town district school.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I only trust the Lord Mayor will not <i>back out</i>!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Happily, the Lord Mayor stood firm, and wrote a
strong letter of appeal to go out with the memorial to
the City Companies.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Buss’ holiday was most profitably spent in
Sweden and Denmark, where she gathered many
educational facts and theories, and where she found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>the Swedish desk, which she was the first to introduce
into English schools.</p>

<p class='c006'>The September campaign began with the Lord
Mayor’s appeal, but progress was still very slow. Miss
Geraldine Jewsbury’s warm sympathy was still a great
comfort, but her letters show the difficulties encountered.
Speaking of one friend, she says—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I must neither ask her to subscribe nor to ask her husband;
in fact, I could not rouse her interest in <i>this</i> quarter. She says she
and her husband have embarked so much in the cause of education
that they can do no more. But <i>it is all for boys</i>, of course. However,
£5 is £5, and I think more of it than any other £5 I ever
<i>earned</i>. I could never have believed in the difficulty of getting
money for such a good purpose if I had not <i>tried</i>.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Give my love to Miss Buss, and tell her not to lose heart.
But it is trying and uphill work! Only her example strengthens
others in all ways.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“Selwood Park, Sept. 3, 1871.</div>
<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Miss Ridley</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“The enclosed letters will show you that I have not
forgotten that poor Mr. Ruskin was to be my main hope. His
illness has been very serious, and I know not at this moment where
he is. I shall certainly see him when there is any chance of his
being able to take thought of anything. I know how much interest
he would have taken in the schools, and, I hope, will take in
them yet.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The lady in whom I most trusted to give me money has
given me <i>just</i> nothing, and no promises even, nor expression of
interest, and the aggravating thing is the <i>reasons</i> she gave! She
has anticipated for <i>two</i> years the sum she gives to charitable
objects or social progress to—the Society for Advancing Female
Suffrage!!!</p>

<p class='c017'>“I have been entirely unsuccessful so far, but am not going
to lose heart nor hope; for success does not depend on whether
an object is supported by many or by few. And I feel that these
schools are just the most important step that has yet been taken
for women, giving a solid foundation of good training, and Miss
Buss has been raised up and trained for the emergency. She is
doing the real needful work without minding the clatter of nonsense
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>that is being talked about Woman’s Rights, and all the rest of it.
The waste of <i>money</i> is the least part of one’s regret.</p>

<p class='c017'>“My counsel and advice is, first, to write to the Lord Mayor
and tell him that his example would be readily followed, and
entreat him to lead the forlorn hope and give a small sum of
money. I would write the letter gladly, only <i>you</i> can do it better,
and are in the midst of the business of the schools.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I will write to Mr. Roebuck, and see if he can rouse any
interest. Do you also write to Mrs. Newmarch. Tell her the
urgency of the matter; write such a letter as she can give her
husband—not too long, but urgent. Write to Miss Cobbe, and beg
her to make an article of appeal in the <i>Echo</i>, and at the same time
interesting. Shoot all these arrows <i>at once</i>, and some of them
will hit.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I feel ashamed and disgusted at the tardy and small response
you have met with; but, as nothing really good <i>ever</i> dies out, I
am not cast down, and I feel just the same interest as at first—I
have still one card to play for you, as I have not made my appeal
to Mrs. Huth, and that I will do, both to her and her husband,
sending on your letter. Do not let Miss Buss lose heart. Give
my love to her, and tell her that though I have not brought in
anything yet it has not been for want of talking and trying. There
is always a dead pull in all undertakings to get them uphill; the
wheels seem to stick fast, but, after a while, if <i>this pull is continued</i>,
they move. Let me hear from you again, please, and</p>
<p class='c026'>“Believe me, yours very truly,</p>
<p class='c027'>“<span class='sc'>Geraldine E. Jewsbury</span>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>I wrote to Mr. Ruskin, mentioning Miss Jewsbury’s
request, and with great pleasure received a kind letter
in reply, expressing interest in what I had told him of
the school, and of the feeling of the founder. But,
having at least three times more work on his hands
than he was able for just then, he could do nothing till
after the Christmas vacation, when it might be possible
for him to come to see what was being done and what
he might be able to do to forward the work.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was always a regret to us that this visit never
came to pass. Miss Buss and her girls missed what
would have been a great delight, and Mr. Ruskin also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>missed the sight of healthy and womanly work and play
which could not have failed to please as well as to cheer
him in its hope for the future.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Buss’ letters for the next few months show the
effect of the strain of suspense and of hope deferred—</p>

<div class='c024'>“Myra Lodge, 10 p.m., Sept. 27, 1871.</div>

<p class='c017'>“Not ten minutes’ leisure till now, dear Miss Ridley. Teaching
in the morning, a large Dorcas meeting in the afternoon, and an
overwhelming mass of business correspondence—not nearly gone
through yet, however.</p>

<p class='c017'>“First, an answer from the Goldsmiths has come. You do not
need to be told what that answer is.</p>

<p class='c017'>“An idea has struck me that it might be well for us to ask
those who have subscribed so far whether they give to one school
more than another? If not, let us divide the subscriptions, and so
hand over to Camden Street some of our money. This is <i>between
us</i>—just now, at least....</p>

<p class='c017'>“I do not think we must, in any way, appear adverse to the
City movement under Mr. Rogers.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I feel we have forced him into action, and, as our motive is
to help women generally, and not the women of Camden Town
only, to have driven him to act is one result, and a great one, of
our organization.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Why I think of the division of subscriptions is that no doubt
some of the people would prefer to help the poorer school. If so,
I should prefer their subscriptions going in the way they wanted.
I am sure that my old pupils help their own old school, and do not
care for the new and unknown one....</p>

<p class='c017'>“I have written to the Lady Mayoress, and will write to Miss
Cobbe, asking her to let me <i>call</i>. Of course I shall give her your
note. What a dear, bright, ever young heart Miss Jewsbury has!
If you had done nothing but interest her, your work would have
been <i>great</i>. She has saved me almost from despair at least on
two occasions.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I don’t mind our Board meetings, and really have never but
once been like what we suppose a caged lion to be.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It is now the amount of the work, and the sort of unsettled
state we are in, that overdo me. But Mr. Danson is helping to
reduce money matters to order, and to be relieved of the management
of that would be really a comfort.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>“We have now 190 girls in the Camden School; one father
has come to live in the neighbourhood on purpose to send four
girls. I scarcely know what to do for teachers, and am in correspondence
with all sorts of people. Old pupils do not seem
available, or they are not mature enough.</p>

<p class='c017'>“We must have some more furniture too, as there is not enough
in Camden Street for the present number. The ventilation in the
Camden Road is not nearly good enough; but I am compelled
to <i>act</i>, and so must risk observations from the Board. We ought
to be thinking of building for the Camden School; but money,
money, where is it to come from?</p>

<p class='c017'>“I hear Mr. Mason, of Birmingham, who has just spent
£200,000, or some such sum, on his orphanage, intends to give
£30,000 to education. Mrs. Sheldon Amos went to him about the
Working Women’s College, and got a sort of promise. I always
intended to get at him if I could; so, hearing of her visit, I wrote
straight off to the wife of the Town Clerk of Birmingham, Mrs.
Hayes, to ask for an introduction, saying a visit to Birmingham
would be nothing if there were the least hope of getting help;
even if one only induced him to give part of the money to girls
at Birmingham something would be gained. A visit there is
therefore looming. Mrs. Hayes gives me a warm invitation to
her house. She knows me through an old pupil, who is governess
to her children, and called on me here when in London.</p>

<p class='c017'>“(Ah, ah, how I wish we could get a fine building for the
Camden Road School! We do want a lecture hall and a gymnasium
so much.)</p>

<p class='c017'>“Two school concerts are on me next week, and a good deal
to think of in connection with them. Musical men are not easygoing:
each one will have the best places for his pupils; each
will go his own way. Most school-mistresses have to deal with
one only; I have three, and also three young women; the latter
were fairly manageable.</p>

<p class='c017'>“A good second would be a great relief to me, and would
enable me to work at something less than express-train speed—a
speed that cannot be continued for very many years. It would be
worth while to raise the pay of my second, as she became more
useful. I never have time to prepare my lessons, which is almost
indispensable if one wishes to teach well.</p>

<p class='c017'>“There has been quite an avalanche of storms raised by
parents lately, mainly because I have had to engage a governess
<i>not</i> trained in the school. She does not therefore understand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>our ways, and causes me much worry; but she is really a good
Christian girl, one who will do well <i>in time</i>. But, as I tell her,
I have to suffer during the process of her instruction.</p>

<p class='c017'>“If the Birmingham invite does not come this week, as I hope
it will not, on Friday I hope to go to Mrs. Hodgson, at Bournemouth,
till Monday night—Monday being our half-term holiday,
and most of my house-girls away. Mrs. H. is the dearest,
sweetest, brightest, most unselfish creature, and I love her dearly!
You will believe me, when I say how much I am learning to love
you. I cannot bear to hear of your being <i>tired</i>. Pray take rest
and get well.</p>
<p class='c026'>“Always your loving</p>
<p class='c027'>“F. M. B.”</p>

<p class='c005'>There came at this juncture a very bright ray of
encouragement in a gratifying letter from the Princess
of Wales. As the Queen had given her name to the
first College, it was thought that the Princess might do
no less for the first Public School for Girls, and the
Memorial Committee made the request, on the principle
of “nothing venture, nothing have.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The following letter was addressed to the Rev.
Charles Lee, as the chairman of the Memorial Committee:—</p>

<div class='c024'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>,</div>
<p class='c025'>“I am directed by the Princess of Wales to acknowledge
the receipt of a letter signed by you, in conjunction with Dr.
J. Storrar, on behalf of the trustees and governors of the institution
established in Camden Town for the promotion of secondary instruction
for girls.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Her Royal Highness fully recognizes the importance and
great need of improvement in the education of girls of the poorer
middle-class, and believes that the North London Collegiate
School for Girls, with its Lower School, will not only to some
extent meet this want, but that it will also serve as a model to
similar schools, the establishment of which in other parts of the
Metropolis, and in the country generally, it may encourage.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The Princess of Wales, therefore, has much pleasure in
acceding to the request that her Royal Highness would allow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>these schools to be placed under her patronage, and has directed
me to forward to you the enclosed cheque for fifty guineas as her
Royal Highness’ contribution to the funds of the undertaking.</p>
<p class='c026'>“I have the honour to be, sir,</p>
<p class='c027'>“Your most obedient servant,</p>
<p class='c035'>“<span class='sc'>M. Holzmann</span>, Private Secretary.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Sandringham, Nov. 15, 1871.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In response to this cheering bit of news Miss
Jewsbury at once wrote off—</p>

<div class='c024'>“Manchester, Nov. 26, 1871.</div>

<p class='c017'>“I <i>am</i> very glad indeed about the Princess. It is the best of
all the many kind things she has done. <i>How</i> did you get at her?</p>

<p class='c017'>“I will write myself to Mr. Novelli, and am going on Tuesday
to Sir Joseph Whitworth’s, and will see if I can move him to
help us! Give my love to Miss Buss. She will ‘see the fruit
of her doings’ yet; and she does not know how much her patient
endurance has strengthened the hands of the many (of whom she
may never hear) who are wearied and ready to lose heart in their
labours. I can speak of what her example is to myself.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch-b2-03' class='c004'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <br /><span class='c013'>“THE SISTERS OF THE BOYS.”</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c014'>“No man will give his son a stone if he asks for bread; but thousands
of men have given their daughters diamonds when they asked for books,
and coiled serpents of vanity and dissipation round their necks when they
asked for wholesome food and beneficent employment.”—<span class='sc'>F. P. Cobbe.</span></p>
<p class='c015'>The great event of the year 1871—from the educational
point of view—was the meeting of the Society of Arts,
at which Mrs. William Grey read her able paper on
Secondary Education for Girls, in which was contained
the germ of the Women’s National Education Union,
and the Girls’ Public Day Schools Company. The
chair was taken by the Rev. William Rogers, whose
great school for boys in Cowper Street was just completed,
and the audience included most of the distinguished
leaders in educational movements.</p>
<p class='c006'>Mrs. Grey took up the question of higher education
for women in all its bearings, and, recognizing the needs
which had to be met, proposed the formation of “an
Educational League,” to embrace all who were actively
interested in the question, and having for its object—</p>

<p class='c014'>“to carry what might be characterized as the Educational Charter
of Women—first, the equal right of women to the education considered
best for human beings; second, the equal right of women
to a share in the existing educational endowments of the country,
and to be considered, not less than boys, in the creation of any
new endowments; third, the registration of teachers, with such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>other measures as may raise teaching as a profession no less
honourable and honoured for women than it is for men.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The discussion following this paper will always
retain historic value, because, as both sides had free
scope, it represents the exact estimate of women which
prevailed at that period. For the women of the twentieth
century—in the serene enjoyment of the results of the
work of the nineteenth century—it will have an interest
of which wonder will form no small part. The women
of 1871, as they listened, had long since ceased to
wonder, but they had other feelings which, happily for
the readers of 1971, will also have acquired the historic
value which attaches to all relics of a far-away past.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was when presiding at this meeting that Mr.
Rogers made the speech, of which every one heard so
much during the next two years, a speech that showed
how he also had yet to learn from experience the difference
between efforts for boys’ and efforts for girls’
schools.</p>

<p class='c006'>In proposing the vote of thanks for Mrs. Grey’s
paper, Mr. Rogers remarked that he could not agree
with one statement—that there was no demand on the
part of parents for a higher education; on the contrary,
there was a widespread dissatisfaction with the present
state of things. Being anxious to establish a girls’
school in connection with the Boys’ Middle-class School
in London, he sent round a paper to the parents of the
boys—numbering about eleven hundred—asking their
opinion, and he received answers, and promises that the
girls should be sent, from about five hundred. He also
disputed the statement that “where pounds were subscribed
for the boys there was difficulty in getting
shillings for the girls,” as he believed that funds would
be forthcoming so soon as the real difficulty—of suitable
sites and good teachers—had been met.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>In passing, it may here be noted that during the
year following this meeting Mr. Rogers succeeded in
securing the required site and teachers, and thereupon
made his appeal for the girls—the “sisters of the boys.”
For the boys, <i>in one single meeting</i>, he had obtained
promises of £60,000, to which another £10,000 was
added. It was the work of months to collect for the
girls the sum of £5000, much less than one-tenth of
what had been given for the boys. What eventually
became of this £5000 will be told in due course.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the strength of Mr. Rogers’ speech at Mrs. Grey’s
meeting, I wrote a letter to the <i>Daily News</i>, stating
that the Camden School was in full possession of the
essential points of teachers and pupils, and now needed
only £5000 for a suitable building.</p>

<p class='c006'>To this appeal there was no response in money;
but, on July 6, 1871, I had a note from Miss Buss
which showed that interest had been excited—</p>

<div class='c024'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Miss Ridley</span>,</div>
<p class='c025'>“Miss Mary Gurney has been here to-day, and she
talks of writing a paper for the Leeds meeting of the Social
Science. I told her about you, and asked her to write to you,
and I also said that a sketch of this, the only public school for
girls, would probably lead to more useful, because more positive,
results than another paper on the general question of girls’
education.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Miss Gurney is the daughter of the shorthand writer to the
House of Commons, and is deeply interested in all educational
questions.</p>

<p class='c017'>“She has made our acquaintance <i>only</i> from your newspaper
paragraph.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I felt what the little children call naughty on Monday—wearied,
dejected, worried, and over-anxious!! But body prevails,
as you know, over mind, and I felt very sorry for what I
said to you.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I send you a <i>Daily News</i> of to-day. The leader will help
on our appeal. Only the editor, all the way through, speaks of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>‘boys’ instead of ‘children,’ which would include boys and
girls.</p>

<p class='c017'>“We meet to-morrow?</p>
<p class='c030'>“Always yours,</p>
<p class='c031'>“<span class='sc'>Frances M. Buss</span>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Early in July a letter of mine in <i>Public Opinion</i>
had been followed by a discussion on endowments for
girls’ schools, which I finally summed up as follows:—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Now, however, we may hope. In this implied support of the
Lord Mayor we see far more than help to the Camden School.
We see in it a hope of some large and united public effort, through
which the Camden School will be only the first of a series encircling
London, and everywhere meeting the same want. A great
step has been taken in the City, in Mr. Rogers’ proposed new
schools there. Two other City schools are also proposed. It
must be remembered, however, that the resident City population
is steadily diminishing. To benefit girls truly the schools should
come to them in the suburbs.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Referring to this hope, Miss Gurney writes—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am extremely obliged to you for your kindness in thinking
of my paper, and sending me such a helpful letter about it. I will
get the <i>Illustrated News</i>. I will also venture to write to Miss
Cobbe, and I will look at your letter in <i>Public Opinion</i>. I think
I have advocated just the same view in my paper. The difficulty
seems to be to constitute the central authority. Any Middle-class
scheme ought to be very superior to our Elementary Education,
which has grave defects. And then, where are our suitable teachers
to be found? From my experience of the world there are few
people like Miss Buss. It will never do to have the teachers of
Elementary schools. But of course all these difficulties must be
met with spirit.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I have been so much interested in your arguments in favour
of public schools, of many of which I had not thought, but I agree
with all. I should have liked to copy it into my paper, and have
acknowledged your kind help, but had not room; so I have stolen
some of your ideas, which I hope you will pardon, and have woven
them in with a curious German report from Frankfurt. Your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>thoughts in favour of a  ‘mixture of classes’ and ‘true independence’
have long been favourite hobbies of mine; but your idea
of an <i>esprit de corps</i> was quite new to me, and I think it most
valuable.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In the <i>Echo</i> of October 10, 1871, there is a report
of the Social Science Meeting at Leeds, saying—</p>

<p class='c014'>“The time of the Education Department to-day was wasted for
a long time by two factious men. They spoiled the discussion of
the papers by Mrs. Grey and Miss Gurney on the special requirements
for the improvement of the education of girls, by two childish
speeches, the one in disparagement, the other in eulogy of woman.
Mr. Baines (the president) had the greatest difficulty in shutting
them up.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In the same day’s issue of the <i>Echo</i> there is a somewhat
sarcastic letter from Miss Cobbe, commenting on
Mr. Rogers’ happy visions of help for girls’ education,
and demanding the practical realization so long deferred,
and especially advocating the claims of the Camden
School to a fraction of the help so liberally bestowed
on the brothers of these girls.</p>

<p class='c006'>The outcome of Mrs. Grey’s papers—read before the
Society of Arts and the Social Science Congress at
Leeds—was a large and enthusiastic meeting in London,
in November, 1871, when the Women’s National Education
Union was formally inaugurated, with Mrs. Grey
as president for the first year. In the year following
H.R.H. the Princess Louise (Marchioness of Lorne)
became president, with a goodly array of well-known
names as vice-presidents, and an acting committee of
Educationalists, professional and amateur. Of this committee,
Mr. Joseph Payne, Chairman of the College of
Preceptors, became the chairman till his death in 1875.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>Woman’s Education Journal</i>, edited by Miss
Shirreff and Mr. G. C. T. Bartley, served as the special
organ of the Union, lasting for over ten years, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>containing a summary of the most important events of
a decade rich in interest for all women.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Buss’ Journal-letters refer to the rise of the
Women’s Education Union, and also to a suggestion
made by a friend that Mrs. Grey, having the public
ear, should make an appeal through the <i>Times</i> for the
Camden School—</p>

<div class='c024'>“Nov. 1, 1871.</div>
<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Miss Ridley</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“Miss Gurney called on Monday. She is willing to
join Mrs. Grey’s association—the National Union for Improving
Women’s Education, or some such name. May I give in your name
as a member, and <i>perhaps</i> worker? I think we ought now to print
an account of what we have done—what say you? Your pamphlet,
‘Pearl and Sea-foam,’ is almost out—I have only two copies.
From what Miss Gurney said, I think she would write a pamphlet,
but I told her I would consult you. Please tell me your opinion.</p>

<p class='c017'>“When you can, I want you to enter into our inner life, and
then some fine day write an account of it—perhaps after my time,
who can say? At all events, a detailed account of Cheltenham
College for Ladies was read, at a Social Science Congress one year,
and perhaps you might do a similar thing for us at a future time.</p>

<p class='c017'>“There is a talk of getting representatives of different educational
bodies on Mrs. Grey’s National Union Committee. If so, I
hope you will represent us. But that appointment must be made
by the Board.</p>

<p class='c017'>“You do not know my ‘pet name’—that given me by my dear

<p class='c005'>Miss Buss was elected on the Council of the Education
Union as representative of the school-mistresses
Association. She was also of great use in sending
information, through me, to a sub-committee of which
I was for a time a member.</p>

<p class='c006'>In readiness for the need of which Miss Buss speaks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>I had been collecting material for an enlargement of
“Pearl and Sea-foam,” but as Miss Gurney was willing
to make the schools the text of her pamphlet (issued
later as No. 3 of the Women’s Education Union Series),
her offer was gladly accepted. In this pamphlet Miss
Buss’ schools are recognized as the model on which
those of the Girls’ Public Day Schools’ Company were
afterwards formed.</p>

<p class='c006'>In December, 1871, Miss Gurney writes—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am extremely obliged for all the trouble you have taken with
my paper. It has been a very difficult task, especially after writing
on the same subject before. I hope you will read my Leeds paper
in the <i>Englishwoman’s Review</i> last month.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I most fully feel the truth of all you say about Miss Buss. I
think her personal influence most wonderful; and, although I
cannot say that she has awakened any <i>new</i> enthusiasm in me,
because an educational enthusiasm has been always a part of
myself, yet I think I am able to see and appreciate her <i>rare</i> worth
and talent.</p>

<p class='c017'>“And yet, in this paper, we must not say anything which will
appear like flattery to those who do not know her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Buss’ own words gave her appreciation of the
help rendered to her own work by this pamphlet—</p>

<div class='c024'>“Myra Lodge, March 25, 1872.</div>

<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>My dear Miss Gurney</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“The pamphlet shall go out to-day to Mrs. Gilbert.
It seems to me that we cannot circulate your paper too widely.
Will you order another one thousand copies, or, if you think more
will be wanted, let us have two thousand.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Should not a copy be sent to the members of the Council of
the Society of Arts, and of the Social Science? Copies will be
wanted for the annual meetings of both these societies.</p>

<p class='c017'>“On all hands I hear how glad people are to have so clear a
statement of our plans.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The Merchant Taylors have given us fifty guineas and the
Dyers five. <i>As yet</i>, no other Companies have responded to our
appeal....</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>“Dr. Hodgson says he has read your paper with great interest,
and that he trusts this strong appeal may help us. He asks whence
you quoted him?</p>

<p class='c017'>“By his advice, I have sent some copies away. During the
Easter recess—from the 17th to the 29th of April—I hope to go
to Edinburgh, in order to see the five schools of the Merchant
Companies: 4400 pupils under one management—two schools for
boys, and two for girls (one of the latter with 1200 pupils, and the
other with 500), and one mixed school.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Do you see the <i>Examiner</i>? It is very liberal in the women’s
questions. A pamphlet, containing a reprint of many—well, <i>several</i>—of
its articles has just been issued.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I think you will not mind my saying that <i>every one</i> likes <i>your</i>
pamphlet—so far as my knowledge goes. When are we to pay
for the first edition?</p>

<p class='c017'>“With all kind regards,</p>
<p class='c026'>“Believe me, yours most truly,</p>
<p class='c027'>“<span class='sc'>Frances M. Buss</span>.</p>

<p class='c017'>“To Miss Gurney.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But this comes some months later. In the mean
time, Mrs. Grey had to buy the experience that afterwards
led to the formation of the new company. The
Journal-letter of November 18, 1871, alludes to the
inaugural meeting of the Women’s Education Union—</p>

<div class='c024'>“Nov. 18, 1871.</div>

<p class='c017'>“Mrs. Grey’s meeting was well attended yesterday, but oddly
enough not one word was said of our schools. This does not
matter much, however.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Mr. Forster’s suggestion is admirable, and ought to be carried
into execution at once. I think Mrs. Grey would make the appeal;
at all events, I will ask her this evening. For the Camden School
only, however, for women, we want about £5000.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It will not do to include the other at present. Miss Gurney
has begun her paper, but I am not very clear about it. I was so
worried by visitors on Wednesday, when she came, that she and
I got only half an hour together, as she had to rush off to Mrs.
Grey’s committee.</p>

<p class='c017'>“If only an agency could be started, with which I was not
ostensibly connected, what a comfort it would be! But just now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>the applications for governesses are overwhelming, and they entail
correspondence which is not compatible with the inner school-work,
which <i>I</i> ought to do. But at present I see no outlet. I
never have leisure to prepare any lessons at all, and it is only this
week I have even been able to give an account of my holiday trip
to Sweden—among the pupils. Denmark is waiting still; it is
necessary to digest one’s materials, to draw up heads, etc., and
these require leisure.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Do you remember the peasant girl, now a first-rate teacher in
Stockholm? Also the Danish peasant girl, who is mistress of the
orphanage at Holstermunde?...”</p>

<div class='c024'>“Dec. 8, 1871.</div>

<p class='c017'>“I fear my last note was pitched in a low key. Mrs. Grey’s
letter enclosed will show you there is no occasion for jubilation,
but I am better, having nearly struggled through my heavy cold.</p>

<p class='c017'>“We had a very long sitting on Monday, but got through some
business, one part of which was that the Treasurers were empowered
to take another house for the Camden School rather than
refuse pupils! I gave my furniture, valued at £140, in the Camden
School, to the trust. My scholarship is to be invested in Consols,
to my disgust, as that will only produce 3 per cent.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Mr. Harries and Miss Ewart are to audit the accounts on the
22nd, and I wonder where the accounts would be if Mr. Danson
did not give so much help to us. Do you know, Mr. Danson is
perfectly delightful. He is so business-like, so kind and patient,
that I can’t see what I should do without him on the one side, and
a certain Annie R. on the other. And I mean this.</p>

<p class='c017'>“We are all quite sick with anxiety about the Prince of Wales,
who is said to be dying. I cannot help being sad about the poor
little Princess—<i>our</i> Princess. My dear love to you. My little
housemaid is waiting for this to post it, and it is past ten, so
good night.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“Board Room, 202, Camden Road, Dec. 12, 1871.</div>

<p class='c017'>“<i>Trust for carrying on the North London Collegiate School
for Girls.</i></p>

<p class='c017'>“Look at this!</p>

<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Annie</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“Are we not getting business-like! Mr. Forster’s suggestion
of a lecture from Professor J. R. Seeley is a good one, but
I doubt whether we should get as much as £100 from the lecture;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>and as Professor Seeley is already largely pledged to the Hitchin
College, I also doubt whether he would lecture for our movement
only. But we can try. I know both Professor and Mrs. Seeley.
They have visited me at Myra, and I have visited them. Mrs.
Seeley is a niece of Mrs. De Morgan.</p>
<p class='c030'>“Your loving</p>
<p class='c031'>“<span class='sc'>Arnie</span>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This last suggestion came to nothing, but Mrs. Grey
wrote to the <i>Times</i>, setting forth in the strongest way
possible the claim of girls in general to the help so
freely given to boys, as well as the special claim of the
Camden School, not only as recognition of Miss Buss’
services, but from the fact that the school was in full
work, and therefore proved conclusively not only the
need for such a school, but also that this need could
be met. She told how Miss Buss, “with a self-sacrifice
as rare as it is noble, had voluntarily handed over
the fruits of twenty years’ labours” for the benefit of
girls, and then, for these same girls, asks that Miss
Buss’ generosity may be supplemented, for the two
schools, by a quarter of the amount given to the one
school for boys in Cowper Street, since, otherwise, it is
to be feared that—</p>

<p class='c014'>“these schools and their able and devoted principal, Miss Buss,
must break down under the strain put upon them, and a great
work which has already done so much for the better training of
girls, and promises to do more, will have to be abandoned.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Among my correspondence of this date, I find a
note respecting this appeal which might account in
some measure for the small response it received—</p>

<p class='c014'>“The <i>Times</i> won’t do things gracefully. I enclose you Mrs.
Grey’s admirable appeal on behalf of the Camden Schools, which
I cut out of the <i>outer sheet</i> of the issue of yesterday. The redeeming
feature is that the letter is what printers call ‘displayed.’
Unfortunately, however, people who buy the paper at the bookstalls
frequently leave the advertisement part behind!”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>Within a month after this first letter Mrs. Grey wrote
again to the <i>Times</i>, stating in detail the response given
to Mr. Rogers’ appeals for boys, and giving as her own
experience, concerning the appeal for girls of the same
class, the following most noteworthy result:—</p>

<p class='c014'>“The answer to my appeal for the Camden Town Schools for
Girls, founded by the energy, ability, and generosity of Miss Buss,
has been £47 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, of which £20 would have been given whether
my letter had been written or not; so that the net result of my
appeal to this great Metropolis on behalf of the sisters of the boys
for whom such a magnificent endowment has been received has
been, in fact, just £27 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>”</p>

<p class='c005'>This second letter brought in about  £100 more,
raising the result of Mrs. Grey’s appeal to £147 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
The total amount collected by all, <i>after three years of
hard work</i>, came to not more than £700.</p>

<p class='c006'>And yet Miss Jewsbury’s hopeful words, written
about this time, were quite true. Public interest was
roused, though not as yet to the point of generous
giving. Miss Jewsbury writes—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Give my love to Miss Buss, and wish her a happy New
Year. The idea of a thorough education for women has now, I
think, taken hold of the public mind, and will be followed by the
desire to obtain it. Miss Buss’s schools will bring forth abundant
fruit. She has borne the burden and <i>cold</i> of the day, but her
work will take root. There was a notice of Mrs. Grey’s letter in
the <i>Manchester Examiner and Times</i>, and a leading article too.
I had seen a nice letter of Mrs. S. C. Hall’s yesterday. Yes, Mrs.
Grey <i>is</i> charming, and <i>good</i> to the core.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The subject was in all the papers. Miss Cobbe did
good service in the <i>Echo</i>, and Miss Chessar in the
<i>Queen</i>. Our hopes had naturally risen high when Mrs.
Grey took the question up so warmly. The disappointment
was proportionately great.</p>

<p class='c006'>And, bad as this might seem, there was yet more to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>follow. During the six months since the reading of
Mrs. Grey’s paper before the Society of Arts, Mr.
Rogers had collected £5000 for a girls’ school in the
City. But some City endowments—the “Datchelor
Charity” and others—had been found available for
girls’ education. Consequently, at the seventh annual
meeting of “the Corporation formed for Promoting
Middle-class Education in the City of London <i>and the
Suburbs</i>,” it was proposed that the £5000—<i>collected for
girls expressly</i>—should be used for the new hall of the
Cowper Street School for Boys (already endowed with
£60,000), this particular sum being just what would
make up the £11,000 needed for a new hall.</p>

<p class='c006'>Several voices, notably that of Alderman Besley,
were raised against this act, and mention was made
that this sum was all that was asked by the Camden
School, <i>in the suburbs</i>, and very close to the City. But
the motion was carried.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was to no purpose that leading journals, as well
as “educational enthusiasts,” were “aghast at the
announcement that a sum of money contributed for the
special purpose of endowing a middle-class school for
girls is to be devoted to the purpose of beautifying and
enlarging the present middle-class school for boys.”
The thing was done.</p>

<p class='c006'>That the school on which so much had already been
expended should, in addition, take the sum, which,
comparatively small as it was, would have sufficiently
endowed the one existing school for girls of the same
class, was a blow calculated to wound to the utmost
the women who were devoting themselves heart and
soul to the effort to help these girls. Mrs. Grey, in a
letter to the <i>Times</i>, expresses this natural feeling with a
strength that was not in excess of the provocation received,
as she says, “It was with painful astonishment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>not unmingled with bitter feelings,” that she had read
the report of the meeting. Her letter ends with a still
stronger appeal to the editor—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Will you, sir, not raise, in the name of the nation, a protest
which cannot be so easily set aside? Will you not at least make
it clear to the public that this is not a woman’s question, but a
man’s question, a national question, and that to leave uneducated
one-half of the people—and that the half which moulds the associations,
habits, and life of the other half—is a course so suicidal that
of the nation which deliberately follows it we are tempted to
exclaim in bitterness of soul, ‘Quem deus vult perdere prius
dementat’?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Buss naturally shared in this bitter feeling, to
which she thus refers—</p>

<p class='c014'>“You have received my outburst of indignation about the City
corporation? Fancy coolly alienating the money collected for a
girls’ school, and then handing it to the boys’ school, on which
<span class='fss'>ONLY</span> £60,000 have been spent! Then the land in Southwark,
purchased as the site of another school, is to be sold, and the
proceeds handed over to the same school. Of course, it would be
infinitely more useful to build a school at Southwark than to spend
the money on the City school.</p>

<p class='c017'>“A protest might well be sent from us against the recent act
in the City—on public and general grounds. Of course we could
not have any claim to that £5000. But it is no matter. Do not
trouble about it. But I do feel so impatient and weary sometimes!
Still, I try to be faithful. Unto the end, let us hope!</p>

<p class='c017'>“Really, I am very despairing, spite of success so far.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But “impatience” and “despair” were never more
than passing moods with this strong, brave spirit, whose
faith went deep down below all check or discouragement.
Here are two notes which end the year 1871 and lead
in 1872—</p>

<div class='c024'>“Myra Lodge, Christmas Morning.</div>

for me to meet you at the Swiss Cottage Railway Station? Please
send word by bearer, and the hour. If the latter plan be agreed
on, we had better meet at 10.30 or 10.45.</p>

<p class='c017'>“After our interview with Mrs. Grey, will you return to lunch
with me, and let us have a quiet afternoon together? A <i>quiet</i>
afternoon for me will be delightful. No consciousness of work
neglected, and no responsibility, will make it really enjoyable to me.</p>

<p class='c017'>“If you will return here, I will ask Agnes to come also.</p>
<p class='c030'>“Yours always affectionately,</p>
<p class='c031'>“<span class='sc'>Arnie</span>.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“Ryde, New Year’s Day, 1872.</div>

one’s self to an All-guiding and Almighty Hand above....</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am already much better for leaving behind all responsibilities.

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>But, however it might be borne, the disappointment
was bitter, more especially in the proof given of the
absolute indifference of the public to the whole question.
Prejudice might have been overcome, opposition might
have been met, but against indifference so invincible no
means seemed available.</p>
<p class='c006'>Mrs. Grey gave it up as hopeless. She frankly
abandoned the old position, and opened out new ground
in making her next appeal directly to the British commercial
instinct. In starting the Girls’ Public Day
School Company there was offered in addition to
thorough education, a dividend of five per cent.</p>

<p class='c006'>The success of Miss Buss had proved that schools
like hers were wanted by numbers sufficient to make
them pay. There was not the slightest difficulty in any
case in raising the £2000 in shares needed to start one
of the Company’s schools in any locality desiring to
have it.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c018'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f7'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r7'>7</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Miss Clough, in her interest in Miss Buss’ work, had proposed to
the National Education Union the formation of a company to supply
school-buildings in this and similar cases. But the council decided to
start its own schools, and nothing came of this proposition so far as
regarded the Camden School.</p>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>This new departure tended rather to hinder than to
help on the endowment of the Camden School, of which
the very <i>raison d’être</i> was a rate of fees too low even to
pay for buildings, a dividend being quite beside the
mark.</p>

<p class='c006'>Money had come in, though slowly, for the furniture
of the Upper School, and this was now quite self-supporting,
though very inadequately housed. What
would, in this school, have gone towards a dividend,
went instead to the salaries of the teachers, higher here
than in any similar institution.</p>

<p class='c006'>But for the Lower School an endowment was absolutely
necessary. Hitherto, Miss Buss herself had
provided all that had been needed beyond the money
subscribed. She had not the very faintest intention of
fulfilling Mrs. Grey’s desponding prognostications of the
abandonment of the scheme as a result of the public
apathy. The precise manner in which it was to be
carried out still remained to be discovered, but she never
wavered in her intention that, somehow, it was to be done.</p>

<p class='c006'>During the year 1872 the pressure on Miss Buss
seemed to be a little increased by this new departure.
In June she writes of it—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Several people have written to me about the £5 shares in the
Brompton School, and my ire was rising.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Mrs. Grey’s handing over <i>all</i> Mr. Morley’s £500 to purchase
shares in the new school shows pretty clearly—in addition to the
Goldsmid gift—what chance <i>we</i> have of help in that quarter.
There can be no doubt that the new school movement is leaving
us <i>high and dry</i>.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I do not feel aggrieved by the Union in the least. It only
makes me more determined to act. Miss Davies shuts herself into
one bit of work; Mrs. Grey into another; I into a third....</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>“Mr. Rogers’ suggestion about the Columbia Market (have you
seen it?) if acted upon, will prevent our getting any help from the
City. He says the market is useless—turn it into a splendid
school <i>for girls</i>! I hope the suggestion may be acted upon; if
he takes it up, he will soon get the money needed. <i>We</i> shall have
no chance at all. The City Companies will vie with each other in
starting this magnificent scheme. City men like to ‘live in bricks
and mortar’—not to say stone. To live in human hearts is not
durable enough.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Between the two schemes, we shall be swamped entirely if
we do not take the bull by the horns and make a huge effort.”</p>

<p class='c005'>There was no real antagonism between Miss Buss
and the Girls’ Public Day School Company. She was
very glad of the work, and helped it in many ways, as
is shown in Mrs. Grey’s letters—</p>

<div class='c024'>“18, Cadogan Place, June 18, 1873.</div>
<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>My dear Miss Buss</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“... I am troubling you again in this matter as there
is a proposal before our Council to adopt your scale of fees in the
new school....</p>

<p class='c017'>“Several people have told me that your meeting yesterday was
a splendid success. I congratulate you heartily, and sincerely
regret not having been able to attend.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I wonder whether I shall live to see similar success won by
the Company’s schools? If we could but get a duplicate of you I
should feel very sure of the success, whether I live to see it or not.</p>
<p class='c026'>“Most truly yours,</p>
<p class='c037'>“<span class='sc'>M. G. Grey</span>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In September, 1874, the following letter was received
by Miss Buss from one of the foremost supporters of the
St. John’s Wood and Hampstead High School for Girls,
a lady whose enthusiasm had first been roused by her
efforts to help Miss Buss’ work—</p>

<div class='c024'>“<span class='sc'>My dear Miss Buss</span>,</div>
<p class='c025'>“I am hoping to work for the St. John’s Wood School,
though on the whole I have met with little sympathy. One of the
objections to the new school will amuse you vastly, namely, that
all the people to whom I applied said that they would not like to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>subscribe to a school that might in any way interfere with yours,
and that the near (!) neighbourhood of St. John’s Wood to Camden
Town might have this disastrous result. Nothing that I could say
convinced my opponents.... If we cannot get the help of the intelligent
and influential persons here, what shall we do?... I feel
sure that you can do much to help us: your name could be on our
committee, though we should not expect you to work.</p>
<p class='c026'>“Yours truly,</p>
<p class='c038'>“<span class='sc'>E. Tolmé</span>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Buss at once took shares in the company,
giving her name to the committee, on which I acted as
her representative. Many of her own friends were
members, as well as educationalists like Dr. Abbott, Dr.
Angus, Professor Huxley, Professor Carey Foster, and
Mr. Norman Lockyer. The new school was built by
Mr. Robins.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the mean time her own work went on slowly
enough. The main hope was now in the Endowed
Schools’ Commission, since the constitution of both
schools had been arranged in harmony with schemes
drawn up by that body.</p>

<p class='c006'>Whilst one-half of the governing body of the North
London Collegiate and Camden Schools for Girls had
formed the memorial committee, occupied with ways
and means, the remaining members had devoted themselves
to working out the details of the constitution,
both parties uniting for the general board meetings, and
there discussing all points in common.</p>

<p class='c006'>In Dr. Storrar, who had all his life been closely
connected with great educational bodies, having helped
in the development of the London University and of the
College of Preceptors, we had a practical educationalist;
as also in Mrs. Burbury, who, as the daughter of Dr.
Kennedy, had breathed education with her earliest
breath; Miss Ewart, too, was in like manner born to
public spirit, as the granddaughter of the William Ewart
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>to whom William Ewart Gladstone owed his name, and
as the daughter of a distinguished member of the House
of Commons, who, for forty-six years, helped in every
advanced public work, especially the London University.
Dr. Storrar and these ladies, in particular, spared neither
time nor pains in working out the scheme, and in enlisting
sympathy with its objects in all likely quarters.</p>

<p class='c006'>But, in the beginning of 1872, the Endowed Schools
Commission had not finished its work, and help from
this quarter was still remote. Some extracts from Miss
Buss’ letters at this time show how very slow was the
progress made in getting funds—</p>

<div class='c024'>“January 10, 1872.</div>

<p class='c017'>“Mr. Ellis <i>privately</i> has sent a cheque for £20 to the Camden
School. Lord Calthorpe has done the same, but as yet there has
been no other response to our memorial letters.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Mrs. Newmarch writes a kind note, to say she means to pay
us a visit when she can, and she sends a guinea from  ‘Mrs. Brown.’
We are getting on, though slowly.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“Myra Lodge, Mar. 10, 1872.</div>

<p class='c017'>“The Camden sites and leases have been pressing much on
me. Nothing has been done about the site. The lawyers are too
dreadful. The land tenure is so complicated that it seems hopeless
to understand it!</p>

<p class='c017'>“I want to talk to you about <i>our</i> trying to get up a City meeting.
The Lord Mayor is favourable to female education. I wrote to
Mrs. Dakin, asking for an introduction to the Lady Mayoress, but
Mrs. Dakin is abroad. I shall try next Saturday through another
channel.”</p>

very anxious to talk philology with you. I have asked all sorts of
people who have been offering me hospitality, and all the women

for my fellow-labourers from time to time.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The Lady Mayoress is going to the Camden School on Friday
next, at 2.30. Do you care to meet her?”</p>

<div class='c024'>“April 20.</div>

<p class='c017'>“Mrs. Tolmés success is delightful! I have thanked her for
enlisting the Baroness, but have omitted to say anything about
the <i>prizes</i>.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>“I did ask about a scholarship, and I have invited the baroness
to pay us a visit. A notice of the £10 donation shall be sent to
all the papers.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The “Edinburgh Schools” here mentioned had been
recently opened by the Merchants’ Company of that
city. Using the money of various old charities that had
fallen into utter abuse, they had made five thoroughly
good schools on the latest and best principles, two for
boys, two for girls, and one mixed. The first school
was arranged for 1200 girls, and had proved a great
success.</p>

<p class='c006'>The account of this work had naturally been of great
interest to Miss Buss, and, as she knew that there had
been every advantage that could be derived from the
possession of ample means, she was anxious to see for
herself what had been done. She therefore devoted her
Easter vacation to the visit to Edinburgh, in which I
accompanied her, dating from this happy time that
closer intimacy which it was my privilege to enjoy.
Dr. Hodgson’s introduction to Mr. Thomas Knox, the
Master of the Merchants’ Company, made our way
something of a triumphal progress, as I find in my
letters home the record of “intense attention from hosts
of masters and other people—to Miss Buss, of course,
I moving round her like an attendant satellite, and
shining in reflected light.” I was still young enough to
be amused at Mr. Knox’s description of the “<i>two</i> ladies
from the south, eminent educationalists,” doing my best
to sustain the character. I could at least appreciate my
opportunities in hearing the talk between Miss Buss and
Mr. Knox. Even apart from their friendship with Dr.
Hodgson, they found a strong bond in their educational
sympathies. In my journal I find him described as—</p>

<p class='c014'>“A tall, fine-looking man, with a grand head, and, I should
think, a great heart. It is he who chiefly has carried the great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>reforms, sweeping away one abuse after another by the force of his
strong will and steady purpose. One is struck by his patriotism.
His feeling for Edinburgh breaks out constantly, and one can see
that his public duty lies as near his heart as any private interest,
while he takes as his family all human creatures, especially all
young things, from the scholars of the Merchants’ Company’s
Schools to the waifs and strays of his own special hobby, the
training-ship. It is exquisite to see how this great, strong man
speaks to the old women at the Home and to the children, with
tender consideration for each individually as well as in general
kindness.”</p>

<p class='c005'>His wife and daughter were absent, so we missed
seeing his home-life, but he showed us all that was most
worth seeing in his beloved city. To Miss Buss it was
real holiday, and nothing seemed too much for her in
that busy week which to me was something of severe
mental strain, as well as unwonted physical exercise.
We must have marched up and down miles of stone
passages and stonier staircases; and I find more than
once the record that I stayed at home to rest, while
Miss Buss took in a few more schools. A “Home for
Boys,” and another for “Aged Poor,” are “merely incidental”
in a day which includes an Art School, and a
School for the Blind, in addition to the ordinary schools.
We saw all the Company’s new institutions, and Fettes
College, as well as Heriot’s Hospital, and the older
foundations.</p>

<p class='c006'>The palatial structures and perfect appointments of
all these schools made Miss Buss, as she said, “go raging
wild with envy,” but this did not prevent her from carefully
noting all there was to see. Nothing was overlooked
that was in any way suggestive. She found a
good system of girls’ cloak-rooms, afterwards adopted,
with her own improvements, in her own new buildings.
She noted that Scotch scones were more wholesome
than English buns for the children’s lunch, and in the
future secured a Scotch baker to supply them for her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>own girls. She discussed time-tables and all the intricacies
of school management, while I listened and
marvelled, and felt more and more like an eminent
educational fraud.</p>

<p class='c006'>Among the few things actually novel to her was the
teaching of pianoforte playing in classes, eight girls
being taught at eight pianos at the same time by one
master. Perfect time was thus secured, as the discord
otherwise would have been quite beyond endurance.
Some modification of this system was afterwards introduced
by Miss Buss into her Upper School.</p>

<p class='c006'>One thing that roused her disapproval, amidst so
much that she admired, was the position of the women-teachers,
who, if employed at all, held only inferior and
ill-paid posts. Whilst in Edinburgh, she lost no chance
of putting in a word for them, and after her return to
London, she wrote: “I am firing shells into the Edinburgh
schools one by one—Mr. Knox, Mr. Pryde, etc.—to
make them use the Local Examinations. Professor
Masson has been here this morning, and he advises me
to go on, as good may come of it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Wherever Miss Buss went she acquired new ideas;
but she also scattered them broadcast. As I had an
introduction to Miss Eliza Wigham, the well-known
leader in all philanthropic movements, we found ourselves
in the centre of work of all kinds, being well
pleased to discover that though Edinburgh might be
ahead in education, London could still hold its own as
regarded the employment of women.</p>

<p class='c006'>I find that we had an afternoon tea, to which leading
workers and teachers were invited, of which I record:
“At our party we have had a grand seed-sowing.
Everywhere Miss Buss throws out hints and suggestions
likely to bear good fruit. There are many persons who
will remember the talk to-day.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>At Gateshead it was just the same. She secured
several pupils for her friend Mr. C. H. Lake; and,
although the sisters of these boys became pupils at
Myra Lodge, she at that time set going the idea of
the Girls’ High School, soon afterwards started, which
took the younger members of these families from
herself.</p>

<p class='c006'>Before leaving Scotland we paid a visit to Dollar,
where Miss Buss saw her ideal system at work, as she
here found an old-established “mixed school.” Her
theories were, on the whole, confirmed; but she found
some drawbacks, which made her content to wait till
all the perfect conditions could be secured.</p>

<p class='c006'>After Dollar, we had a few days of quiet, with
delightful drives in the scenery round the Bridge of
Allan, where our friend Mr. Forster chanced to be
staying at the Ochill Park Hydropathic Establishment.</p>

<p class='c006'>The whole trip was full of interest, and not the least
part of it was the delight of having that full mind pouring
itself out on all possible subjects, and in scenes
where the historic and poetic associations add a new
charm to the beauty of nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>But there was still more to come in an event which,
important as it was in itself, acquired still greater force
when taken in connection with the feelings excited in
Miss Buss’ heart, by the sight of the richly endowed
Edinburgh schools.</p>

<p class='c006'>We broke our journey southwards at Gateshead,
where we visited Mrs. Mawson at Ashfield, a house
well known to many a worker as a place where
pleasant things are wont to happen, and therefore
most suitable for this most happy occurrence. The
large family circle had gathered round Miss Buss, to
hear her recent experiences, and to ask about her
own work, entering into her hopes and plans for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>future of the schools, when a telegram was brought to
her. She read it; and, after a silent pause, rose and,
crossing the room, put her arms round me in her own
impulsive way, as she said, with rare tears in her voice
as in her eyes, “Miss Ewart has given £1000 to the
Camden School!”</p>

<p class='c006'>How much this meant to the founder could be
known only to those who had learnt how near to her
heart was this dream of so many years. If only Miss
Ewart herself could have seen, as we saw who were there,
the joy thus given by her generous act, she would have
been content, even without all that is still to come
out of it to the girls of generations unborn, who will
remember her name with gratitude.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Ewart completed her good work by a large
loan, which made it possible at once to think about
buildings for the Camden School. Miss Buss left me
at Gateshead, and went back to her work with a
renewed energy and courage, which come out very
noticeably in the letters received during the next few
weeks.</p>

<div class='c024'>“Myra Lodge, April 30, 1872.</div>

<p class='c017'>“A few lines before going to the great Suffrage meeting.
Forty new entries in the Camden Road. Thirty, so far, in
Camden Street.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“May 1, 10.30 p.m.</div>

<p class='c017'>“I was interrupted last night by the arrival of a mother—Mrs.
Crookes, wife of the Psychic Force Mr. Crookes. While she was
talking, the cab arrived—no, no; just after she had done talking,
the cab came with Mr. and Mrs. Sep, for me to go to the Suffrage
meeting. We got back at <i>one</i>. We met everybody—Mrs. Tolmé
among others. All day I was driving at express-train speed. At
two o’clock Dr. Storrar came in, and, as he had a committee at
University College at five, stayed till 4.30. I had had no lunch,
and a council of teachers had assembled at four.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The meeting lasted till eight. Tired out, I walked home
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>with Miss Begbie, and found here Mr. and Mrs. J. waiting to
arrange poor Mrs. B.’s affairs with me.</p>

<p class='c017'>“They have just gone. The pressure of new pupils is enormous,
and the reorganization of the school is also heavy. There is just
the same pressure in Camden Street, but I have taken nothing up
there, and cannot till to-morrow afternoon. Teachers, furniture,
etc., are all to be found.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Did I tell you on Sunday night that I asked Dr. Storrar if
the lender of the £3000 was Miss Ewart? He does not answer,
so we can draw our own conclusions.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am to ask her to fix the time for a special meeting, and
must do so to-morrow, if I can find a few minutes.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“Myra Lodge, May 3.</div>

<p class='c017'>“I am sure you will believe in the impossibility of my writing
much. The whole day—four o’clock now—I have been walking
about, organizing classes.</p>

<p class='c017'>“How to dovetail all the subjects of instruction and the pupils
is a difficulty not to be described. Things are getting into order;
but I have found no housekeeper, and want a new teacher.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The Edinburgh papers are untouched, as I have not had a
moment to arrange them. But yours will serve for the School-Mistresses’
meeting.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Don’t be vexed, but the City meeting is quite off, so I judge
from Mr. Elliott’s remarks; also there seems a feeling that all
mention of <i>us</i> to the Princess Louise has been omitted. She
called a meeting of Lord Lyttelton, Mrs. Cowper Temple, and
others, to give her advice, and it seems Dr. Storrar wrote later
to Lord Lyttelton to express his vexation that Lord L. had
not pointed us out as leaders in the question of girls’ schools.
We are to get at Princess Louise, but <i>how</i> is not settled. Dr.
S. does not think we can hold a City meeting.</p>

knew what I only dimly suspected—namely, that she offered to
lend the £3000 also.</p>

<p class='c017'>“She paid the school a visit on Thursday with Madame
Bodichon, and Dr. Storrar says she has grown into a regard
for our work. She was perfectly charming to me to-day, and
especially about Mrs. Bonham-Carter’s note.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I whispered that I could make ducks and drakes of the
£25: buy a dress if I liked, as the money was given to me for
my comfort! She took me by the hand, and said she wished
I would spend it exactly as I liked; it really was at my disposal.</p>

<p class='c017'>“If Mr. Robins is not our architect, I am sure he will exonerate
you and me. I hope he will. Perhaps things will go as we wish.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Dr. S. distinctly told me he thought Miss Ewart had no
particular person in her mind’s eye.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am going to Mrs. Tait in the morning, and out to dinner in
the afternoon. I mention the latter merely to let you know that
I shall be hurried to-morrow.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“202, Camden Road, May 28.</div>

<p class='c017'>“I fear I cannot manage to get to you to-morrow evening.
There is a Dorcas meeting here, followed by a lecture, which will
keep me very late; and I have been under an engagement for
more than a fortnight to go to Mrs. Arthur Arnold’s At Home
(A. Arnold is editor or proprietor of the <i>Echo</i>) at Stanley Gardens,
nine o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c005'>An introduction to the Rev. Stopford Brooke
gave further pleasant encouragement as Mr. and Mrs.
Stopford Brooke visited the schools, and were so much
interested that they even spoke of sending their own
daughters. The distance made this plan impracticable,
but Mr. Brooke’s interest was shown in other ways.
Miss Buss writes—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mr. Stopford Brooke sent yesterday a cheque for £13 8<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i>,
with a note saying his people were away, but he would try again
next year. Decidedly the publication of his sermon would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>helpful to the cause of education, but I hope the right place would
be given to Miss Davies. Please also take care of her note, which
I enclose. Mr. Latham seemed to think we might perhaps get
£300 a year for endowment.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The ‘leaving scholarships’ are like the £100 a year, for three
years, given by the Merchants’ Company in Edinburgh. It would
be delightful to send some girls to Girton College (papers of
which I send you some copies) or to Germany, for music, etc.</p>

<p class='c017'>“If it is fine on Tuesday afternoon, what do you say to meeting
me <i>here</i> at six o’clock sharp, and of our going together to the
Botanic Gardens?</p>

<p class='c017'>“We should at least be quiet; and a walk would be pleasant,
or a drive to the entrance, and a walk inside? I want to see
you.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“June, 1872.</div>

<p class='c017'>“Oh, how very heavy the work has been this week! I was
almost overdone this morning. Last Saturday, I had to hunt
about for sites, etc. There is scarcely anything to be found that
will do for the Camden School, and I have been nearly tearing my
hair, because the ground opposite the Upper School may be sold
for a chapel. It is very trying to see that splendid site, actually
the only available spot in the district—nearly half an acre—commanding
Hampstead, Kentish Town, Highgate, and Holloway,
and yet be unable to find any one willing even to lend on the
security of the land and building. From eighty to ninety years is
the length of the lease. I have been doing my best to get people
to take up the Upper School—MY very own work—as Miss Ewart
has done the Lower, but so far have been unsuccessful. Could
we get at Mr. George Moore anyhow? Mr. Reeve, of Portland
Chapel, is his guide, philosopher, and friend. Could we enlist
Mr. Reeve?</p>

<p class='c017'>“It is very wicked, I know; but, all the same, I can’t help it.
I feel quite sick with despair, with that land opposite, and such
worry from overcrowding inside our school-house. We must
refuse pupils. And we might have such a splendid school for
three hundred girls! If only we could get the sinews of war!</p>

<p class='c017'>“Why should not Agnes write to Mr. Froude herself? Mrs.
Arnold’s <i>soirée</i> enabled me to speak to several people—notably to
Mrs. Pennington, who is doing her best to persuade her husband
to give us a thousand pounds.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I did not tell you that on Thursday morning I called on Mr.
Jowett at Cowper Street. He was occupied in taking over the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>schools an American and the Warden of the Fishmongers. My
card was taken to his room, where was standing a tall, gentlemanly
clergyman, whom I at once recognized as <span class='sc'>Mr. Rogers</span>.</p>

<p class='c017'>“At first the mere mention of my name did not strike him, but
presently he took up the card, peered curiously at it, and then
turned round to me. We had some talk. I told him about the
land. He said, ‘Nothing venture, nothing get. You must take
the land. Secure it by putting your £1500 down; then go boldly
to the public with a <i>clear, definite scheme</i>. People will not listen
to vague plans.’ He said, ‘Don’t amateur your plans. Get a surveyor’
(he mentioned one), ‘pay him to get up the information, etc.’</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am quite sure we have been amateuring too long. We
ought to carry in Mr. Robins. I have sent his testimonials to
Dr. Storrar, and Mr. Robins’ application will come on Monday.
In three days Mr. Robins can put us into a position to say we
want so much.</p>

<p class='c017'>“We must <i>do</i> and <i>do</i> and <i>do</i>.</p>

<p class='c017'>“But Mr. Rogers says, ‘We shall get no help for the Upper
School.’ I could have said, ‘You are a University man. How
did you get your education? From old endowments? or from
your father’s pockets <span class='fss'>ENTIRELY</span>?’ But that would have been
rude; so I was silent.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am resolved <i>not</i> to let the Lower School be put down on
the new land <span class='fss'>FIRST</span>. Both must be done together, or the Upper
<i>first</i>. You see why it would be dangerous to risk the Upper
School. If we can only get help for the <i>Lower</i>—so be it. We
will then <i>borrow</i> for the Higher, and do the two together.”</p>

apart from that of education generally; and the real question which has

itself: how is the child of either sex to be trained to the measure of the

Dec., 1881.</i></p>
<p class='c015'>In August, 1872, things suddenly assumed a fresh
aspect. It was not till July, 1879—still seven years of
waiting and working—that the goal was finally attained
in the opening of the new schools. But, from
August 2, the date of a letter from Mr. Roby, the
Secretary of the Endowed Schools Commission, to Miss
Buss, this goal came within sight. This letter Miss
Buss enclosed to me, with a few words of comment,
which touched me not a little.</p>
<p class='c014'>“I send you a copy of a note which I got yesterday. Please
send it on, with my love, to Mrs. Offord. It is the realization,
probably, of our hopes. Yet I take it as quietly as I did Miss
Ewart’s donation of a thousand pounds—not ungratefully, I
trust. I have offered a meeting on Tuesday morning, but expect
that will be too late. So, in October, things must be settled.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I leave this place on Monday, so as to get through heaps of
work in town, before starting for the Continent. My brother Sep
will be in Brussels by the time we get there. Probably it will be
better to say <i>very little</i> about Mr. Roby’s note. ‘There’s many
a slip,’ etc.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The letter, of so much interest to us all, ran as
follows—</p>

<div class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>“92, Kensington Gardens Square, W., Aug. 2, 1892.</div>
<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Miss Buss</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“I am very glad to be able to announce to you that
the Commissioners have proposed to the Brewers’ Company, who
are the Governors of Aldenham School, to subsidize the Camden
Schools, and that the Governors have agreed to this.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c018'><sup>[8]</sup></a> As to
details, nothing is settled, but I hope to get a handsome sum
towards building, so as to complete, with what you have collected,
all that is necessary, and also some annual endowments.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The next step is for our Assistant-Commissioner to have a conference
with you and your Board, so as to ascertain what is the
amount needed, and what is the best form the assistance should take.</p>

<p class='c017'>“If your Board could meet Latham anywhere (either at the
Camden Schools, or at 2, Victoria Street) on an early day next
week, it would be well.</p>

<p class='c017'>“If not, the matter must wait till October, as we are all dispersing
for the Vacation.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Will you please to write to Latham at once?</p>
<p class='c030'>“Yours very truly,</p>
<p class='c031'>“(Signed)      <span class='sc'>H. J. Roby</span>.”</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f8'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r8'>8</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the reign of James II., “Richard Platt, a wealthy brewer, left
a piece of land in trust to the Brewers’ Company to maintain a school in
his native village, Aldenham.” On this piece of land now stands St.
Pancras Station. The value of the property became too great for only
the one school to be maintained, and the sum of £20,000 was given in
order to build our two schools, one in the Camden Road, and the other
in the Prince of Wales Road; in addition, a similar sum was given as
an Endowment, thus using the money in the Parish of St. Pancras.</p>
</div>

<p class='c006'>On the following day I had another note from Miss
Buss, and for some time to come the whole story of the
hopes and fears, the anticipation and delay, may be given
in her own words from these letters—</p>

<div class='c024'>“Aug. 8, 1872.</div>

<p class='c017'>“I had a note yesterday from Mr. Latham, agreeing to an
appointment with our Board, next Tuesday morning, at 2, Victoria
Street, ten o’clock.</p>

<p class='c017'>“This is your notice; so please don’t say you were not invited!</p>

<p class='c017'>“In consequence of the delay in getting Mr. Roby’s note to
me, I asked for an appointment next week, when Mr. Roby meant
<i>this</i> week. But, as it turns out, my mistake is of no consequence,
as Mr. Latham, the Assistant-Commissioner, is still in town.”</p>

<div class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>“Aug. 10, 1872.</div>

<p class='c017'>“I did not write to you yesterday, because I expected that
very, very charming note, which came this morning. Dr. Storrar
wrote to me to say—however, I enclose his note—that the meeting
had better take place at 202, Camden Road. So I wrote at once
to every one <i>but you</i> (and Miss Ewart and Mrs. Sidgwick, who are
abroad), to say that our meeting was to be held in Camden Road,
and not in Victoria Street. Twelve notes in all! Still, I think
Dr. Storrar is right, and as only the trouble fell on me, it was better
to ask every one to change. I hope Mr. Latham will not mind.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“Aug. 11, 1872.</div>

<p class='c017'>“Any money given to us by the Endowed Schools Commission
will be for <i>both</i> schools. My only hope for the Upper School has
been centred in the Endowed Commission. Our plan of placing
the schools side by side will make the ground more easy to get....
I have long expected a grant from the Commission, but these
things are so long about that there was a doubt on my mind
whether the grant would be made for years to come.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Mr. Latham says the part of the Platt income available for
St. Pancras amounts to about a thousand a year. He does not
like the notion of the two schools being together. So it is proposed
that we ask for about £16,000 for the two buildings and ground
for the Lower School, on the Platt estate, which belongs to the
Brewers.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The good news had come just as Miss Buss was
starting for her summer holiday, this year spent in
Germany and Switzerland. On her return she writes—</p>

<div class='c024'>“Myra Lodge, Sept. 14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.30 p.m.</div>

<p class='c017'>“Out of sight has not been out of mind, I assure you.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I got back yesterday at about one o’clock a.m. and have ever
since been in a whirlpool of work and consequent worry.</p>

<p class='c017'>“There are more than <i>fifty</i> new entries for the North London
School, 54 in fact, and more are coming on Monday.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Over sixty are entered in the Camden School. The new
buildings look very well—as a temporary thing—but must be
furnished immediately in order to receive the new pupils; teachers
must be found—housekeeper, servants, etc. I have been dashing
through all sorts of work to-day, to get things in train.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Anyway, our success justifies our taking the new place, and
puts us into the way of paying for it.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>“My holidays were perfectly delightful; but I must tell you
about them at some other time.</p>

<p class='c017'>“My dear Annie, I am not sure at all about success not being
too elating! I will try to guard against myself, but feel doubtful.
Success of a certain kind is necessary to make one learn one’s
self; but too much may be puffing up.</p>

<p class='c017'>“However, it has gone midnight, so I will say no more than
that I am</p>
<p class='c030'>“Your loving</p>
<p class='c031'>“<span class='sc'>Arnie</span>;</p>

<p class='c017'>“that I am glad you are all well; that I shall not get any time
to myself to-morrow, as I am to go to my father after service
for the rest of the day, and that Monday will be a dreadfully hardworking
day.</p>
<p class='c017'>“Will you take care of the <i>Times’</i> account of the Prize Day?
The mighty Thunderer sent his own Reporter!”</p>

<div class='c024'>“Myra Lodge, Dec. 10, 1872.</div>

<p class='c017'>“There has been a long—2½ hours—conversation with Mr.
Roby and Mr. Latham. It is proposed to send us a draft of the
scheme before it is published, and this draft is (if possible) to be
<i>here</i> by Monday week, the 23rd.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Next Monday we shall send out notices for a <i>special</i> meeting
to consider the draft.</p>

<p class='c017'>“If the Brewers will give the sum £40,000, it is calculated that
the buildings will cost from £20 to £25 per head, and about 400
girls in each school; but there will be <i>sites</i>, law, and scholarships
to be provided.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Mr. Roby thought the sum mentioned would not be too much
for the two schools. This school is to be a <i>First Grade</i>, fixed pay
of mistress £100 per annum, and a maximum cap. fee of £3.
So my income might amount to £1300 per annum! The Camden
mistress might get about £450 as a minimum, or £700 as a
maximum. £200 endowment for rates, repairs, and £200 in each
school for scholarships.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“Jan. 1, 1873.</div>

<p class='c017'>“My head aches at the thought of the worry of settling the
claims to entry of the candidates waiting for admission. Your
friends are somewhere about fiftieth.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Our scheme is not yet published. I am anxious to see it in
the <i>Times</i>, so that the three months may soon pass.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>Then came six months of waiting before Miss Buss
writes, on July 31, 1873—</p>

<p class='c014'>“You will be glad to know that the Endowed Schools Amendment
Act has passed the Commons. The Lords may turn it out.
Perhaps they will. Won’t that be dreadful? I don’t know when
the reading takes place.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But on August 9, she writes from Bruges to the
Rev. S. Buss—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Of course you know that <span class='fss'>OUR</span> Act—the Endowed Schools
Commission—is really an Act now. It is mentioned in the Queen’s
Speech.</p>

<p class='c017'>“This morning, a copy of the scheme <span class='fss'>AS PUBLISHED</span> has been
sent to me. So the Commissioners have lost no time. In three
months—that is, on the 7th or 8th Nov.—the scheme will be
prepared for presentation to the Privy Council and then to Parliament.
So that, humanly speaking, the whole scheme will be
accomplished in a year’s time.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It is curious how little elated one is, when fruition is so near!”</p>

<p class='c005'>The next letter to me comes in the same strain,
dated August 26—</p>

<p class='c014'>“The Scheme is now advertised, and must wait three months,
in order that opposition may be made. Then it goes to the Privy
Council, and next year to Parliament. Altogether we may expect
the twenty thousand (<i>cash</i> value, <i>i.e.</i> about eighteen thousand
pounds) some time next year.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am most deeply grateful, but I am not elated. One’s
elasticity gets sadly diminished as one grows older.”</p>

<p class='c005'>After this a whole year elapses, filled with steady
work in the schools, and brightened with gleams of help,
such as are recorded on June 4, 1874—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Within the last half-hour a note has come to me from Mr.
Owen Roberts, clerk to the Clothworkers’ Company, to say they
give us £105 per annum, during pleasure, for scholarships: 50
guineas to Girton, and two of 25 guineas for Merton. It is very
pleasing.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>The reason for this prolonged delay was shown at
the next date, November 18, 1874—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mr. Lee called at the office of Committee of Council a few
days ago, to ascertain how our scheme was progressing.</p>

<p class='c017'>“He found that the Vicar of Aldenham had been opposing it,
and that practically not anything has been done. It will be again
advertised, and then wait two months, and, if opposed again, must
go before Parliament. So there is no chance of its passing for an
indefinite period. Shall I say, if ever?</p>

<p class='c017'>“And the question now arises what are we to do about other
matters? Are we to go on as we have been doing? What are
we to do? Submit, I suppose, to the inevitable. But is it inevitable?</p>

<p class='c017'>“Altogether, I feel we are in an <i>impasse</i>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A month later comes a little more hope—</p>

<div class='c024'>“Oct. 8, 1874.</div>

<p class='c017'>“I heard to-day (from a governor of that St. Martin’s School
which carries off Miss Derrick) that he had met a Brewer who
talked quite warmly of our school, and also of the plan to take up
the North London Collegiate School for boys, but that the head
wanted good money consideration for it. I am very glad to
hear this in every way. This last certainly entitles <i>me</i> to ‘good
consideration,’ and not to lectures from—various persons!”</p>

<p class='c005'>The next step comes in a note from Mrs. Grey—</p>

<div class='c024'>“18, Cadogan Place, Jan. 18, 1875.</div>
<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>My dear Miss Buss</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“I enclose a note I received on Saturday morning from
Mr. Richmond, which please return. I congratulate you with all
my heart on this crowning of your labours.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Mr. Holloway has given us no further sign.</p>
<p class='c030'>“Most sincerely yours,</p>
<p class='c027'>“<span class='sc'>M. G. Grey</span>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This news of course came in due form to the
governing body, but it seems to have been known to
various friends earlier, giving them the opportunity of
expressing their sympathy, as, in sending me Mrs. Grey’s
note, Miss Buss remarks—</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>“Mrs. Grey’s note enclosed one from Mr. Richmond, secretary
of Endowed Commission, saying that the Lord President of the
Council—I suppose that means Education Department—‘had
approved of the scheme for giving Miss Buss’ Schools the Platt
Endowment’—or words to this effect. Curiously enough, I am
not in the least elated, but have a sort of choking sensation when
I stop to think.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Mr. Fitch wrote to me on Saturday somewhat to same effect,
and Miss Davies, as I told you, gave me a message from him, on
the 14th, Sep’s birthday, and Dr. and Mrs. Hodgson’s wedding-day.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Are you willing to beg a little for the foundation of a Chair of
Education? The Scotch have <span class='fss'>JUST</span> founded two, and the Government—Conservative
too!—have given £10,000 to complete them.
We might get some help from Government if we got £5000 before
asking it.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“Endowed Schools Department,</div>
<div class='c039'>“2, Victoria Street, S.W.,</div>
<div class='c039'>“April 12, 1875.</div>
<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>My dear Miss Buss</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“Aldenham and the North London Schemes were both
approved by the Lord President on Jan. 15. The former was, on
petition laid upon the table of the two Houses of Parliament; but
no petition was presented praying that the latter should be so
submitted to Parliament. However, the time provided by the Act
has expired, and both schemes will almost certainly be approved
by Her Majesty at the next Council.</p>

<p class='c017'>“So it is the opinion both at the Council Office and here, that
the Schemes are as safe as anything can be which has not actually
received formal and final sanction.</p>

<p class='c017'>“With the kindest good wishes,</p>
<p class='c030'>“I am ever, my dear Miss Buss,</p>
<p class='c031'>“Very truly yours,</p>
<p class='c026'>“<span class='sc'>J. G. Fitch</span>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>On May 14, 1875, I received this welcome note—</p>

<p class='c014'>“<span class='sc'>My dear Annie</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“The Queen signed our scheme at yesterday’s Privy
Council. The news has just come from Mr. Fitch.</p>
<p class='c030'>“Ever your loving</p>
<p class='c031'>“<span class='sc'>Arnie</span>.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>This looked like the end of all anxieties. But there
were still four years to elapse before that point was
reached. Action was taken at once in the appointment
of Mr. E. C. Robins as architect, and Miss Buss’ spare
time went in plans and in consultation with him at
special committees without end. It had to be discussed
over and over whether the two schools should be together
or separate; the choice of sites occupied time and
thought, and, interesting and exciting as it all might be,
it was all so much added to the pressure of the work,
where success meant increasing numbers and constant
reorganization in both schools.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here is a specimen of the extra worries that from
time to time came to swell the account—</p>

<div class='c024'>“June 8, 1876.</div>

<p class='c017'>“A new complication has sprung up. The Charity Commissioners
write to ask how much money we intend to put by
yearly, to accumulate at compound interest, to buy up the lease
when it expires. We must call a meeting. It seems to me like a
rent-charge, and if we are to do this, I want to know <i>how</i> we are
benefited?</p>

<p class='c017'>“We had better have been left alone. Suppose the school
numbers went down, where would the governors be?</p>

<p class='c017'>“In my lifetime, too, this would mean paralysis of every thing
we need, in order to put by money.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It is <i>very</i> trying.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This difficulty was overcome, but still the plan
remained for both schools to be erected on one site—</p>

<div class='c024'>“June 10, 1876.</div>

<p class='c017'>“Mr. Latham has written a long (private) letter to me in which
he objects (as I do in my heart) to both schools being put on the
same site, and suggests cutting down our plans and <i>borrowing</i>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Again sweets mingled with the bitter, when Miss
Buss could report on December 18, 1876—</p>

<div class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>“<span class='sc'>Dearest Annie</span>,</div>
<p class='c017'>“Will you return Mr. Owen Roberts’ letter? Is it not
a delightful Christmas box? A whole hall!”</p>

<p class='c005'>This letter announced the intention of the Clothworkers’
Company to add the Great Hall to the new
buildings contemplated by the Brewers’ Company.</p>

<p class='c006'>But still came further difficulties—</p>

<div class='c024'>“Jan. 25, 1877.</div>

<p class='c017'>“What do you think of my feelings at reading the following
passage in the last letter from the Charity Commission? ‘We
sanction the plans for the Camden School, on the distinct understanding
that the buildings of the Upper School remain, for the
present, in abeyance.’</p>

<p class='c017'>“Poor Mr. Robins! He wants to go on with the Camden,
but that seems to me to doom the Upper School. Is it not a
constant worry? We must face the only possible outlet: Mr.
Latham’s suggestion of ‘raising the fees without delay.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>The next letter is dated February 8, 1877, and shows
Miss Buss in one of her (fortunately rare) depressed
moods; but it also shows her usual self-sacrifice—</p>

<p class='c014'>“We have to-day received a note, saying that, unless we have
new facts to lay before them, the Charity Commissioners <i>adhere
to their decision</i>, though they will hear what we have to say on
Thursday. This means that the Upper School must be left as it
is, and the Camden be begun.</p>

<p class='c017'>“There seems no outlook. On the whole, matters look very
gloomy. I have been struggling so much against a sort of sick
despair that I am literally sore all over. The revulsion from
hope to a state of hopelessness has produced on me the strange
bodily soreness alluded to.</p>

<p class='c017'>“There seems only one chance, and that is, to give an annual
sum of £800 or £1000 a year towards the debt out of my income
from the school, and to make my friends insist on the plans being
carried out. If, in addition, we raise the fees one guinea per
annum, <i>i.e.</i> 7<i>s.</i> per term, we shall realize another £500, and the
saving of rent, when buildings are completed, will add another
£300. All this could be applied to paying the debt, so that the debt
could soon be paid off, supposing the school to go on successfully.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>“The discipline of life is very hard, and one’s faith is not as
strong as it ought to be. I do try to cast all my care on Him,
who careth even for me; but it is very, very hard to cling closely.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I have to go to Cheltenham to-morrow. I shall not be home
until <i>late</i> on Saturday night.</p>

<p class='c017'>“No doubt the sun is still shining behind the clouds!
Perhaps even these may clear off in some unexpected way.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“Feb. 13, 1877.</div>

<p class='c017'>“Yesterday’s meeting went smoothly. Miss Ewart was very
kind. She told me in my room that she was quite sorry for me
and that she sympathized strongly.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Mr. Buxton and Mr. Worsley, as representatives of the donors
of the money, mean to protest against abandoning the Upper
School, or delaying its buildings. Mr. Lee and Mr. Thorold also
will make a stand; the former is coming up on purpose. I will
send you a line to say what hope there is.</p>

<p class='c017'>“We have another meeting on Monday, of which you have
probably had notice.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The governors granted all the things I asked for, in the way
of salaries, house expenses, etc. Mr. Robins was not kept waiting,
and got away when he had explained to Miss E. the ventilation
matter.</p>

<p class='c017'>“At the last meeting, he was kept two hours, and then not
summoned. It made me quite fidgety and uncomfortable. I think
his patience is <i>almost</i> exhausted. What a good friend he is!</p>

<p class='c017'>“I wrote a note to the chairman for yesterday’s meeting,
offering—(1) on condition of not letting the Upper School be ‘put
in abeyance,’ (2) of raising the fees, and (3) of adding the sum so
obtained to the rent saved by the buildings (about £800 per
annum)—to pay another sum of £800 per annum towards the
building fund, during my working life, or so long as necessary.
This note was read in my absence.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I must, as Alfred says, be allowed ‘to endow my own child.’
I also wrote to Mr. Lee, making the same offer. I tell you, as you
would have heard it had you been able to be present.</p>

<p class='c017'>“My very dear Annie, if only some of my cares would save
you from yours, how thankful I should be.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The answer from the Charity Commissioners is expected
next week. I should think it will be favourable.</p>

<p class='c017'>“All this discipline is strengthening, and helps one to strengthen
others, if one will but learn the lesson it is meant to teach. I have
not been rebellious this time, I think, but have tried to use means
and be content with the issue.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“April 14.</div>

<p class='c017'>“Mr. Worsley writes to say that the Brewers’ Company will
take up the loan of £8000, and therefore there need be no delay in
beginning the Camden School.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Also that there will be no necessity for me to insure my life
for the debt.</p>

<p class='c017'>“So ends our great difficulty!”</p>

<p class='c005'>In July, 1878, there is a note referring to the work
involved in laying the memorial stones of the new
building, and an indication of delay, since Miss Buss
says—</p>

<p class='c014'>“The Clothworkers gave us a cheque for £2500, which will
carry us on till October, by which time we hope either to have the
freehold or the Alice Owen money. If not, I am to advance what
I can, and that wonderful Mr. Robins will also advance, if necessary.
So far as I can understand, the Charity Commissioners have
suggested to the Brewers that the latter should lend us money, at
a moderate rate of interest, from their other educational trust, the
Alice Owen, in Islington. The committee met to discuss and
report on the security, etc. I hear that the best security will be a
life insurance taken up by me, but nothing was settled.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The grand <i>finale</i> came at last when the buildings
were completed, as more extracts will show—</p>

<div class='c024'>“March 14, 1879.</div>

<p class='c017'>“Mr. E. N. Buxton was splendid to-day at the governors’
meeting, and he urged that we should go on, and never mind
about the Charity Commission difficulties. We have asked the
Princess of Wales!”</p>

<div class='c024'>“April 3, 1879.</div>

<p class='c017'>“The Princess of Wales accepts our invitation to open our
new buildings and give the prizes. I do hope nothing will prevent
her keeping her promise. <i>As yet</i> I do not want the fact known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>in the school. I shall be torn to pieces, and have to fight over
every examination paper and mark, because every girl, and her
parents, will be so resolved to get a prize from the hands of our
fair, young, and beloved Princess!</p>

<p class='c017'>“I want, in the future, <i>Foundation Day</i> to be always a day of
importance in the year. Twenty-nine years! Almost a lifetime.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“June 28, 1879.</div>

<p class='c017'>“How are you all? I often think of you, but the pressure of
work now is hardly to be imagined! Independently of the Royal
visit, there are the festivities of the girls themselves, in connection
with the New Hall. Some French proverbs to be acted, and some
extracts from <i>Les Femmes Savantes</i>, also the final scene in the
<i>Merchant of Venice</i>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>For a very pleasant little sketch of the school buildings
I am indebted to Miss Edith Aitkin—</p>

<p class='c014'>“The school buildings, which are the fruit of so much thought
and endeavour, stand at the corner of Sandall Road, a few yards
back from the main Camden Road. They are of dark red brick,
and group themselves round a part of the original structure which
is three stories high, and which culminates in a conical-roofed
tower, from which each morning a bell rings out to summon the
neighbourhood and all and sundry happily, not ‘unwillingly, to
school.’ It is to be regretted that small and rather mean-looking
houses crowd round too closely to allow the ordinary passer-by
to form any adequate idea either of the size of the place or of its
real dignity of proportion. The building falls naturally into two
parts; first, there is the original structure, modified and extended,
facing Sandall Road; and secondly, round the corner is the Clothworkers’
Hall, and the main body of class-rooms behind it. This
hall, with its long, stained-glass windows, their tops breaking the
line of the roof, and its handsome gateway of honour, is the most
interesting feature of the building as seen from outside.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The usual entrance is at the corner, in the very middle of the
school, and the impression received is at once delightful and
characteristic. Frances Mary Buss, the daughter of a painter,
all her life delighted in light and colour. She was no ascetic, but
aimed always at full use of all good gifts. As one enters to the
left is the head-mistress’ sitting-room—the ‘Blue Room,’ reminding
one that blue was her favourite personal colour, the colour she
wore as a girl, the colour of the satin dress in the early Victorian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>portrait painted of her by her father. The tiles of the fireplace,
painted by the elder girls, are green and blue, and, dare one say,
Morris-y before their time. In front we see a stained-glass
window, to the memory of pious founders, Dame Alice Owen, and
Alderman Richard Platt. To the right is a handsome brass recording
the main facts of the foundation of the school. On each
side of this are doorways leading to the office, where visitors are
received in the first instance, and to the library wing. Passing
forwards, we mount a few steps and turn to the left into the hall.
This was always Miss Buss’ pride, and deserves the exclamation,
‘Oh, how pretty!’ which nearly every one makes on entering it
for the first time. Other schools have halls, some large and fine
in their way, but I do not think there is any other so bright and
cheerful, so warm with harmonious colour, so <i>pretty</i>. At one end
is the main platform, with the organ—the gift of old pupils—recessed
in the wall behind it. The long windows, with window-seats and
high ledges on which are plants, pour down coloured light along
one side. Some are already filled with stained glass, and the
middle one, which has always been called Founders’ Window,
because it was partly filled by the arms of those companies and
individuals who have endowed the school, is to be completed as
the special memorial of her who was, after all, our main founder.
Along the opposite side and across the end runs a gallery of
pitchpine. The walls have a dado of pitchpine, and are lined with
smooth terra-cotta brick, let into which at one end, under the
gallery, are two medallions, one a portrait of the Princess of Wales,
to mark the day of her visit, and all that it signified, ‘with a white
stone,’ as Miss Buss said. Five class-rooms open into the hall
along one side under the gallery, five more on to the gallery, and
others on to a corridor above. To secure quiet in the hall for
examinations, etc., curtains can be drawn shutting off the part
under the gallery as a passage-way to the class-rooms. These are
bluish-green, and, with the flowers of the platform and window-ledges,
give a pretty effect of colour. To the left of the platform
hangs Miss Buss’ portrait, so that she seems to be amongst us
still in a strange quiet fashion.</p>

<p class='c017'>“To describe one class-room is, to the outsider, to describe
them all. A teacher’s platform facing thirty desks, with a large
slate or blackboard behind—Tobins’ pipes, and ventilators over
the doors—this is the now familiar appearance of a schoolroom.
More distinctive features are the window-gardens, the pitchpine
dado, and eminently practical lining of smooth brick, on which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>numerous photographs display themselves. Miss Buss’ Roman
visits explain the fact that very many are views of Rome and of
classical sculpture. To those interested in the details of the school
class-rooms take on distinctive features. In one is the challenge
cup held for the term as the result of a singing competition amongst
a number of classes. In another are copies of Raphael’s Cartoons.
In another a very special and original fireplace decoration. In
some we notice spinal chairs, or modified desks, recommended for
special girls by the lady doctor attached to the school.</p>

<p class='c017'>“A complete survey is a long business, and even a cursory
inspection involves some walking, for we cannot omit to mount
to the end of the top corridor to see the large drawing-school, with
its array of casts, glass, perspective planes, etc. This is lighted
from above, and contains over the fireplace a large painting by
Mr. R. W. Buss, of an Elizabethan Christmas, throwing out a fine
glow of colour. Several small isolated rooms on this floor also
are used as music-rooms.</p>

<p class='c017'>“On the gallery floor it is absolutely necessary to inspect the
lecture-room and laboratory. The former can seat about a hundred
and fifty girls, and is provided with a proper lecture-table for
experiments, and also with a lantern and screen. The laboratory
is fitted with working benches for twenty-four girls at a time. In
the little room between is a really good balance for the use of the
more advanced students.</p>

<p class='c017'>“A plunge into the basement must follow, for the care with
which provision has been made for cloak-rooms, lavatories, kitchen,
dining-room, and drying-room for wet clothes in winter, is very
striking. Also a long passage, floored with wooden bricks, leads
to the gymnasium, a splendid room a hundred feet long, and about
forty feet high. This offers a certain amount of compensation for
a very moderate playground behind the school. The playground,
such as it is, is immensely prized for rounders, skipping, etc., while
competition is very keen for the three fives courts which open on
it at one side. The gymnasium is in constant use all the morning,
for every class goes down there for a gymnastic lesson, on Miss
Chreimann’s system, twice a week, besides a daily short drill directed
by the form mistresses. A special class is held on one afternoon
for additional gymnastic exercises, and another for medical drill,
when girls with a tendency to some special defect are put through
special exercises recommended by the doctor mentioned above,
who examines all the girls of the school at certain intervals.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Visitors may very well be glad to rest before leaving. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>main library will probably contain sixth-form girls studying under
a strict silence rule. Not to set a bad example, we will pass
through to the museum to do any talking. The teachers’ library
is beyond again, a pretty room with several sofas, and a window-seat
under the stained-glass window which decorates this wing.</p>

<p class='c017'>“There are many details one would like to comment upon,
such as the fountains on each floor supplied with filtered water,
the special taps to be used in case of fire, with directions as to the
best method of procedure hung up beside them, the plans displayed
for reference of the whole system of gas- and water-pipes.
All these are very eloquent of her whose dream—realized as all
dreams are not—has borne the translation into a reality which can
never be truly prosaic, and stands here in solid brick, the North
London Collegiate School for Girls, Sandall Road, Camden
Road, N.W.”</p>

<p class='c005'>On July 18, 1879, the whole of St. Pancras was astir
with the unwonted excitement of a Royal visit, and the
crowds that for miles lined the streets showed their
loyalty by hearty acclamations.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c006'>The Prince and Princess, accompanied by the
Countess of Macclesfield and Baron Colville of Culross,
with Mr. Holzmann and Lieut. Clarke, were met at
the door of the new building by Miss Buss and the
Bishop of Rochester—then chairman of the Board—passing
through a double line of governors on their
way to the library, where Miss Aitkin, the winner of
a Girton Scholarship, presented a bouquet of Malmaison
roses. The whole party then proceeded to the tent
erected in the playground, where the Camden Street
pupils waited to receive their prizes from the gracious
lady whose coming had been so ardently desired.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>THE GREAT HALL, NORTH LONDON COLLEGIATE SCHOOL FOR GIRLS.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Adjournment to the great hall followed, when the
girls of the Upper School had their turn, a hundred and
fifty being made happy possessors of prizes from the
same kind hand. Songs and speeches came next, and
the Prince certainly looked as if his words were no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>empty compliment, as he said that none of their many
functions had given greater pleasure either to the
Princess or himself than their visit to these schools.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the library, where tea was served, the Prince and
Princess talked for some time with Miss Buss about
her work. In addition to the whole body of governors,
there were present Canon Spence, Vicar of St. Pancras,
the Rev. William Rogers, Founder of the Cowper Street
School, the Rev. Llewellyn Davies (Miss Davies being
unable to be present), Sir T. Fowell Buxton, Mr. Edward
North Buxton, the Masters of the Brewers’ and of the
Clothworkers’ Company, Mr. Robins, the architect to
the schools, and other friends.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the same evening, the occasion was celebrated
by a dinner given by Canon Spence and the Churchwardens
of St. Pancras, when the health of the founder
of the schools came after that of the Royal visitors.
Mr. Robins, in giving this toast, remarked that “Miss
Buss had been of great help to him in the building of
the schools, for she was a thoroughly practical woman,
and knew more about plans than many men.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Taking it altogether, there was every ground for the
satisfaction which, as the Rev. A. J. Buss said, in response,
his sister must feel in a day—</p>

<p class='c014'>“to which she had long looked forward, and to which she would
look back with gratification, of which no small part would be due
to the recognition of her services by the representatives of the
parish in which she had spent her working life.”</p>

<p class='c005'>From among the innumerable letters of congratulation
pouring in from all sides a few may be given which
were specially treasured by the Founder, who from this
day felt herself set free for the internal work of the
schools, all anxiety being ended as to their external
conditions.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>Foremost among these is one from Mr. Spencer
Charrington, who, as Master of the Brewers’ Company,
thanks Miss Buss for his reception, expressing his full
satisfaction in the completion of the work in which the
Company had taken so deep an interest.</p>

<p class='c006'>Not less gratifying was a testimony from Mr. Fitch
to the scholastic value of Miss Buss’ own special part of
the work—</p>

<div class='c024'>“5, Lancaster Terrace, July 23, 1879.</div>
<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>My dear Miss Buss</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“Let me congratulate you, as I do most heartily, on the
remarkable success which has attended your candidates at the
London Matriculation. I know of no school, either for girls or
boys, which, having sent up sixteen candidates, has passed nine of
them in the Honour division and in the First Class. Nobody
needed any additional proofs of the wisdom and value of the
methods which you have adopted, and which you have done so
much to extend and popularize. Still, every new evidence of the
fact must be gratifying to you; and I assure you it is not less so
to the many friends who know of your work, and who have long
recognized it as some of the soundest, the most fruitful, and the
most beneficent work of our time.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The high proportion of success attained by the female candidates
was the subject of special remark at the Senate this afternoon;
and I need hardly say, of special felicitation to a good
many of us.</p>
<p class='c026'>“Yours very truly,</p>
<p class='c027'>“<span class='sc'>J. G. Fitch</span>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>To the same effect is the expression of warm sympathy
from Mrs. Grey—</p>

<div class='c024'>“Harbledown Rectory, Canterbury, July 20, 1879.</div>
<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>My dear Miss Buss</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“I must write you a few lines to congratulate you on
your splendid opening ceremonial and prize-giving. When I
remember the position of the schools when I had the good fortune
to make your acquaintance, and compare it with the statements
made last Tuesday, it seems like something in a fairy-tale. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>yet with what ceaseless toil has each step been won. It does
one’s heart good, and makes one think better of life, to see such a
brave, life-long fight as yours crowned at last—crowned, too, while
your head can still wear the crown, and with years before you in
which to ripen the fruits of your victory. I have often feared that
you would break down under the strain of final success come too
late. Thank God it is not so.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I do not know when I shall see you, unless you come to Rome
at Christmas.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Do not forget me on my shelf, and believe me ever,</p>
<p class='c026'>“Yours affectionately,</p>
<p class='c027'>“<span class='sc'>Maria G. Grey</span>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Not less warm, nor less warmly appreciated, was a
letter from Dr. Thorold, who had acted as the first
chairman to the united governing body, after the reconstruction
which admitted the representatives of the
Brewers’ and the Clothworkers’ Companies. During his
chairmanship, Dr. Thorold had been raised to the Bench,
but, with all his new duties, as Bishop of Rochester, he
had remained faithful to the work of which he had been
one of the very earliest friends—</p>

<div class='c024'>“Selsdon Park, July 19, 1879.</div>
<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Miss Buss</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“I must write one line of warm and sincere congratulation
to you, on what I may call the coronation day of the work to
which you have given your life.</p>

<p class='c017'>“While I was careful privately to inform the Prince of Wales
of the service you have so conspicuously rendered to the education
of girls for so many years past, all that he and the Princess saw
must only have confirmed their impression of the solidity of the
work to which they gave their cheerful and ample recognition.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I say to you, God bless your work, and you in it, to the glory
of His Holy Name!</p>

<p class='c017'>“And I say it as one of your warm and sincere and many

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“The relationship between head-mistress and teachers
was surely most unique, for Miss Buss seemed never to
tire of having her teachers about her, and even in the
holidays they were constantly at her country house.”</p>

<p class='c006'>So writes one of the members of the staff, whose
knowledge dates from the time when she was a “very
naughty little girl of seven, constantly sent into the
‘parlour,’” where she hid behind the door, waiting till,
with a pained expression, never forgotten in all these
years, Miss Buss would turn to say, “Marion, here again!
I am so sorry,” and then take the weeping child on her
lap, and talk till she could be sent away with the kiss
that made her happy as well as good.</p>

<p class='c006'>That this loving influence was successful is proved
by the sequel—</p>

<p class='c014'>“One day, to my great surprise, Miss Buss asked me if I would
like to become a teacher in the school! What I should have
missed in my life if I had refused I dare not think, for, from that
day to this, it has been a life-long pleasure to be with her, to share
in even so small a degree her work, and, above all, to feel her
inspiration!”</p>

<p class='c005'>And so many more of the staff had, in like manner,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>been pupils that the habit of “mothering” them went
on, and was quite naturally extended to new-comers.</p>

<p class='c006'>From another of the staff we have, in three scenes,
a life-story. The first shows Miss Buss at her happiest
with a little child—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I cannot tell you how much I owe her—nearly everything,
I think, that makes life worth living. I do not remember any
time in my life when her name was not to me a loved and
honoured one.</p>

<p class='c017'>“My sister was a pupil of the school before me, and when I
was quite little I remember longing for my tenth birthday, when
I should be old enough to go there myself. I did not, as a matter
of fact, go till several years later, as I was rather a delicate child.
My first introduction to Miss Buss must have been when I was
very small, for my sister used to tell me how she took me into the
office, and how Miss Buss set me on the table before her and put
my two little feet together, as she told me I was not <i>quite</i> ready
for her class just yet. How like that is to her way with little
children! I think I must have loved her from that very time!”</p>

<p class='c005'>The child is a woman grown as we see her again—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I was in great trouble and perplexity, and in the midst of it
went to spend my holidays with Miss Buss at Fécamp. It was
nearly midnight when we reached her, but she was sitting up for
us, with some hot soup ready, and everything was thought of as
it might have been by my own mother. I had no mother then;
but when Miss Buss took off my wraps with her own hands, and
folded me in her arms, I felt that a second mother had indeed
been given to me. Perhaps I felt this the more because I was
with her at Herne Bay when the news came of my own mother’s
sudden death. It was a Sunday morning, and the trains would not
allow of my going home till later in the day. It would have been a
terrible time but for Miss Buss’ tenderness. She seemed to feel with
me as if the loss were her own. I shall never, never forget it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In sorrow, in joy, or in disappointment she was ever
ready with comfort, with sympathy, and with cheer.
The third scene is given in a letter, sent with the
remark: “How characteristic it was of her warm sympathy
with all with whom she had to do”—</p>

<div class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>“Nov., 1881.</div>
<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>My dear Emily</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“Old pupil and friend of so many years! I send you
my warmest congratulations. I am very glad for you and our dear
friend Mrs. Bryant, also for Florence Eves and Constance Dicker.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It seems to us short-sighted mortals that it would be desirable
to have our pleasures <i>un</i>mixed, but it never is so. My pleasure is
alloyed by my dear R——’s and E——’s failure, and yours by the
absence of your dear mother! But ‘all things work together for

<p class='c026'>“Always yours lovingly,</p>
<p class='c027'>“<span class='sc'>Frances M. Buss</span>.</p>

<p class='c017'>“To Miss Emily Findon, B.A.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Equally to the point is another note, of which the
recipient says: “The whole tone was so strong and so
strengthening, so different from the many letters of
kind, but more or less worrying, sympathy received
at the time”—</p>

<div class='c024'>“Schlangenbad.</div>
<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>My dear A——</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“I am very sorry to hear that you and X—— have
failed to get through the ‘Intermediate.’ I send you my love and
sympathy. Do not fret. You will succeed later on, when, as I
hope, you will try again; and your knowledge will be all the
firmer for having to work longer.</p>

<p class='c017'>“You will, no doubt, carry out the proposed plan, viz. go to
Cambridge for a year, and leave the degree till after? You will
have a very happy time at Cambridge, I know.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Have you heard how Y—— is getting on in Sweden? How
well I remember my delightful holiday there.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And with an account of life at a German spa, and
messages to other members of the family, the letter
ends, hopeful and cheery.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was always delightful to watch Miss Buss with
those of her former “children” who had expanded into
the dignity of B.A., or B.Sc., and were entitled to wear
the gown and “mortar-board” appertaining to this new
rank. No mother ever took more interest in her girls’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>first party frock or presentation robes than did Miss
Buss in those early days in the then quite novel attire
of her “girl-graduates.” Mrs. Bryant had not been a
pupil in the school, but she was young enough to pass
for one, and the sight of her gorgeous gold-and-scarlet
doctor’s gown was a supreme joy to her older friend, to
whom no such distinction had been possible in her own
young days. There was never a touch of envy or of
selfish regret in this sympathy with the winners of the
honours for which she herself had longed in vain—no,
not in vain, since that longing had helped to open the
way to those who had since outstripped her in the race.
Miss Toplis, in her sketch of Miss Buss, in the <i>Educational
Review</i>, calls attention to—</p>

<p class='c014'>“two characteristics which may perhaps be known only to those
in daily contact with her. One was that jealousy and selfishness
were impossible to her nature; the other, her power of living in
the lives of others. The success or distinction of friend or colleague
was one of her greatest pleasures. No one could share
such pleasures as Miss Buss did, and the loss of her ever-ready
sympathy in joy or sorrow is one of the realities we cannot
yet face.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In such sympathy, Miss Buss certainly well earned
the right to the exaltation expressed in a postscript to
a letter on “guild” work to Mr. Garrod, when she says,
apropos of the recent success of Miss Philippa Fawcett
at Cambridge, “Thank God, we have abolished sex in
education!”</p>

<p class='c006'>There are some amusing little touches of the purely
feminine in connection with these first academic gowns
and hoods, which were presented by the staff to its
first graduates at a fancy-dress ball given by Miss
Buss in honour of the occasion. The hoods were made
among themselves, the pattern being taken from that
of Sir Philip Magnus, in the intervals of his inspection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>of the school. Mrs. Bryant cut them out, and the pieces
left over of the yellow and brown silk are still in the
drawer where thrifty housewives keep their pieces.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may be imagined that no small excitement prevailed
among the girl-graduates about the first public
appearance at Burlington House in the full dress. On
the first occasion of the presentation of degrees to
women, the shy counsel prevailed, and the ladies went
up in their usual garb. The next step is thus described
by Mrs. Bryant—</p>

<p class='c014'>“But the following year we called a meeting to settle among
ourselves, if possible unanimously, the course to be pursued. I
confess I resented the idea of being denied my academicals as
much as I have thought it hard to appear as a number only in
the Senior Cambridge lists years before. There was much hesitation
on the part of several, however, but in the end I was instructed
to write to the Registrar enclosing our resolution to wear the
academic dress if no objection to this course was made by the
senate. There was no lack of comedy in the situation—consulting
a body of staid and serious gentlemen as to whether we should or
should not wear the robes to which we were entitled by the
University regulations. However, it was necessary to allay all
doubt, and the message from the senate received in reply settled
the question for that time and henceforth. We have often smiled
over these little incidents, seeing what universal approval was at
once won for our ‘gowns and hoods.’ And at school, on festive
days, when these are worn, the poor Cambridge graduates—graduates
in all but name—grieve because they have no such
symbol with which to deck—it does not veil—their femininity.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It may not be out of place here to give some extracts
from letters to Miss Buss from Mrs. William Grey
which show how needlework is regarded by the leading
educationalists. Speaking of the Maria Grey Training
School (in connection with the College), Mrs. Grey
writes—</p>

<div class='c024'>“Rome, Nov. 27, 1880.</div>

<p class='c017'>“I also wish to give a yearly prize of £2 to the school for two
subjects. You have suggested Botany and Needlework. But as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>I know nothing of botany, and have always said that needlework
should be taught at home to girls above the elementary school
class, I should prefer English or French. If, however, you have a
special reason for wishing for a Botany prize, I will at once agree
to that instead of the French.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“Hôtel du Louvre, Rome, Jan. 7, 1882.</div>

<p class='c017'>“Your pleasant and affectionate letter reached me some days
ago. The kind feeling you express warms one’s heart, at this
distance from home, when one feels very acutely too often that one
has drifted away from all who know, or care, or are cared for. One’s
life feels so useless, and the current of life seems so strong in
England that those who can no longer go on with it have a sense
of isolation which kind words like yours break in upon most
soothingly.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I wanted to tell you that you have nearly, if not quite, converted
me to the needlework in schools to which I have always
been opposed on our council—not from any want of realizing the
importance of the art, but because it is one that ought to be
taught at home. I was a great worker till a few years ago. In
all our young days we made everything we wore, and I was so fond
of embroidery that I scarcely trusted myself to look at it in the
morning, lest I should be tempted to waste my time upon it. I
tell you this that you may see how little likely I am to undervalue
the art; and if mothers are so foolish or so ignorant as not to
teach it, then, sooner than leave it untaught, I acknowledge that
we ought to take it up.</p>

<p class='c017'>“But with our scanty time and overcrowded subjects, the
difficulty is very great. This reminds me of what I thought a
good thing in the St. Martin’s Lane School—and I believe it was
your friend Miss Doreck who established it—and that was a prize
for the best piece of needlework <i>done in the holidays</i>. That stirs
mothers as well as daughters.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Those who were inside the University Movement
had many a quiet laugh over the baseless terrors of the
outsiders who prophesied the dire results to arise from
the possession of degrees by women. I remember the
appreciation with which Miss Buss repeated a story
she had just heard from one of her girls, who had gone
to a dance shortly after gaining her B.A. degree, whilst
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>the subject was still matter for talk. Her partner, feeling
himself quite safe with this peculiarly fair, sweet,
girlish-looking girl, in her pretty evening frock, had
made himself merry over the lady-graduates, winding
up with the remark, “There is always something quite
unmistakable about them, don’t you know! You can’t
fail to spot them at a glance!” His very amiable
partner only replied gently, “Do you think so?”</p>

<p class='c006'>But one of her friends proved less merciful, and the
poor young man found himself in a position to sympathize
with another victim, also at an evening party,
who had been for some time talking, without knowing
it, to the fair winner of a prize essay on some abstruse
point of law. When at last he discovered her name, the
shock was so great that, without waiting to collect himself,
he blurted out, “What! <i>You Miss Orme?</i> Why,
I thought you hadn’t an idea in your head!”—a remark
naturally treasured by that lady as one of her most
cherished compliments.</p>

<p class='c006'>To those who are familiar with life at the North
London Collegiate Schools, knowing the relations
already indicated between the head-mistress and her
staff, there is something of the same entertainment in
one of the press notices relating to Miss Buss and her
work—almost the only notice not wholly sympathetic.
It did, indeed, do full justice to her exceptional qualities,
but it concludes with a remark worthy of preservation
as a valuable fossil for future explorers into the early
history of the new education. The reviewer feels that
he “cannot let the vague sentiment occasioned by her
death pass without an honest criticism of her work,”
thus concluding this criticism—</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is perfectly true that ‘the influence of her work stretched
beyond her own two schools,’ as the <i>Times</i> says; but perhaps
there has been as much loss as gain in this. The movement for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>founding ‘High Schools for Girls’ spread, and Miss Buss’ establishments
were the models; the consequence is that a High School
education only fits a girl to be a High School teacher—and she
could scarcely choose a worse calling.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It must be inconsistent with the dignity of a
“Saturday Reviewer” to explain himself, since this
writer remorselessly leaves the whole class of High
School teachers—including, of course, those of the
“model establishments”—under the ban of this hopeless
condemnation.</p>

<p class='c006'>It could be wished that this critic might have gone
over at least two of the schools thus judged, and have
been present at some of the varied “functions,” when
the head-mistress was found in the midst of her “children.”
The teachers holding their classes might possibly
have failed to please him, since he still holds the belief
in “sex in education”; but the girlish laughter of the
gymnasium, where it was difficult to distinguish teacher
from pupil, would have rung in his ears with a pleasant
chime; or that same gymnasium on “Founder’s Day,”
with its show of useful garments for the poor, and of
ingeniously constructed toys for the children of the
hospitals, would have been a sight to the credit alike
of teachers and taught; or, again, if lucky enough to
witness a performance of the Amateur Dramatic Club—an
association among the teachers—he might have
gone away comforted by the knowledge that girlish
grace and brightness, as well as womanly thought and
goodness, are not the exclusive prerogative of women
<i>outside</i> the new public schools for girls.</p>

<p class='c006'>One of the members of the Amateur Dramatic Club
writes—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nowhere was Miss Buss’ organizing power more visible to
us girls than as stage-manager. In the summer of 1882, for the
last time, the Sixth Form gave <i>tableaux vivants</i> on two or three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>consecutive days. Miss Buss herself said she could not undertake
them again, as the preparation fell too heavily on her and the staff
at the end of the summer term. For us, after our London
Matriculation Examination it was only rest and pleasure. They
were a brilliant success; and Miss Buss praised us openly for the
way in which we had worked for each other, and the pleasure we
had shown in each other’s parts. Looking back, I am convinced
that it was to her that we owed the kindly spirit which did indeed
animate us, and still brings back that summer as a delightful
memory. It would indeed have been difficult to quarrel when
she was working her hardest to make each one enjoy herself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Very far indeed from dull or prosy were the associations
of school or college to these girls. Here is one
bit of fun, from some “Tableaux” given in 1869, for the
benefit of Hitchin, which realized £13. At the close
of a series of very artistic pictures, the curtain rose on
a concourse of European nations, and Britannia, coming
to life, advanced to the front, with an appeal written by
an “Old Girl,” an appeal not quite obsolete even in
our day—</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>Of the graver side of their work, and as giving an
idea of the kind of relation existing between Miss Buss
and her “dear colleagues,” or “dear fellow-workers,” as
she loved to call them, Mrs. Bryant gives us an outline,
which lets us see not merely the workers themselves,
but also the high quality of their work—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have been asked to write some account of these latter—perhaps
we might call them triumphant—years of my dear friend’s
life-work, as I saw them in the light of my close connection with
her, and the marvellous friendship she extended to me. These
were the years when she had entered, in one sense, into the fruits
of her labours. The school she founded had become a public
school—‘Miss Buss’ school’ still—but immortalized. The women’s
educational movement, in the moulding of which she had been a
potent force, had taken shape, and was moving to its goal—that
goal of equal opportunity with the hitherto more favoured sex,
which we younger women are apt to regard as our natural birthright,
although we have not entirely secured it yet. There were
many worries for her still, and very much work on educational
problems; but as regards the general question of the education
of girls, the critical turnings on the road were practically passed
when I joined it, and to reverse the course of our educational
efforts would have been like turning back the Thames at—well,
not London Bridge—say, Maidenhead.</p>

<p class='c017'>“In 1875, the future of women was, I believe, much more
certain than it appeared. It may be that I think this because
it was always taken so much as a matter of course in the logic of
my family circle. It had never been suggested to me in my life
that I had not an equal birthright to knowledge with my brother.
Hence it happened most naturally that I was an early candidate
for the Senior Local Examinations, out of which came my
acquaintance with Miss Emily Davies, and afterwards with Miss
Buss. I remember seeing her among her girls in the intervals of
the examination; and she, as I afterwards learned, was interested
in the girl whose chief subject was mathematics. Our family
birthright was specially in mathematics, and all of us, boys and
girls, grew up to cultivate that soil. I dwell on this fact here
because it was as a woman who could teach mathematics that
Miss Buss first sent for me. She believed that young girls should
be taught by women, and she wanted to build up mathematical
studies.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>“Presently a time came when I resolved, not to do a little
teaching, but to throw my whole life into the work of education.
Especially I wanted to teach girls mathematics. I thought that
women’s lives would be happier and sounder if they had, as a
matter of course, their fair share of the sterner intellectual discipline
that had been such a joy to me. My father was a born
teacher and an educational enthusiast. Moreover, to his scientific
habit of mind it was as natural to regard teaching as a scientific
art as to believe that girls should be fully educated. My feeling
about these things was, in the first instance, the continuation of
his. Then I was early a disciple, in matters philosophical, of the
great Mill; and my first definite idea of a science of education,
comparable in practical efficiency to the science of medicine, was
built up out of a suggestion in the pages of his great work on
Logic. I had just begun to be a student of psychology, and was
so profoundly interested in problems of life and character that
I was strongly drawn to turn my taste for scribbling, then very
strong, to writing novels of a serious workmanlike kind. However,
I was resolved that they must be first-rate novels, and I had
doubts—wise doubts—that I could count on myself for such. But
in education the work was sure to be good world-building work,
however humble, if honestly done, and my interest in psychology
could take practical shape in it. So I resolved to leave the pen
for leisure moments, to take to blackboard and chalk instead, and
thus to work out real results in thought and character—that
is, if I could get the chance. And presently the best of all
chances was given. An old pupil of the Camden Street School
had been a student with me at Bedford College, and from her
I obtained an introduction—a great boon, I thought it—to the
founder and head of the North London Collegiate School.</p>

<p class='c017'>“So I first saw Miss Buss in her own home, in the drawing-room
of Myra Lodge, gracious, dignified, strong of head, tender
of heart, as I ever knew her afterwards. She gave me an hour
or more of her precious time, and explained to me clearly and
graphically, as she was wont, the then present position of affairs
as regarded the education of girls and the prospects of teaching
as a professional career. Great was her zeal at all times, and her
ambition in the cause of the women who work for their living, and
so she laid stress on the new opportunities for making a position
and an ample income that the educational demand was opening
up to women, a profession with a few great prizes and many
smaller ones having taken the place of the resident governess’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>limited outlook. So she told me about the new Endowed Schools
for Girls, and, among other things, that the great prize (financially
speaking) would be the projected St. Paul’s School for Girls, the
mistress of which would have a salary rising to as much as £2000
a year. Alas! that was a project which is only a project still, and
the North London Collegiate School remains, as it was twenty
years ago, at the high-water mark of remuneration for women’s
labour. It was her view that, for the dignity and efficiency of
teaching in this branch and for the good of women-workers
generally, there should be many more prizes at least as great,
and at all times she was much concerned that reasonably good
salaries should be secured, especially for that class of assistant
teachers who remain at work for the best part of their lives.</p>

<p class='c017'>“But the central interest of that first conversation turned, to
my mind, upon the expression of her views about the importance
of teachers being trained for their work. It seemed to her so
obvious that she who undertakes to carry out an undertaking so
delicate and difficult as that of education should first make as
careful a study as might be of the end to be attained and the
means of attaining it, and should be trained as an artist is trained
in the <i>technique</i> and spirit of his work. She was, above all things,
practical, and her feeling in the matter was of practical origin,
while my feeling, which coincided with it, sprang rather from a
theoretical root. She was an artist’s daughter, and her method
of judgment was largely the artistic method. She saw her
problems whole, as concrete ends to be gained, and she found
her way to them intuitively as she went on. She always saw
truth in the concrete, and was so little <i>doctrinaire</i> herself that the
<i>doctrinaire</i> character in other people did not rouse her antipathy
and interfere with her perception of merit in their theories. It is
the pure theorists who are most impatient of each other.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The great artist zealous for his work, and intent on its perfection,
is eager to learn all he can about it—to assimilate the wisdom of
other workers in his field, to think about it in all its bearings, to
learn to see, to practise, to be criticized, to be trained. This, I
take it, was the attitude of mind in which Frances Mary Buss
some forty years ago, conceived the idea of training for teachers as
a universal need from which secondary teachers should not be
exempt. Before the school in Kentish Town was opened, Mrs.
Buss went to the Home and Colonial Training College and put
herself through the training of the elementary teacher. One may
well wonder whether any other woman in the same rank about to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>open a small private school ever dreamed of such a preparation as
needful. But to these two, mother and daughter, it seemed simply
essential, and when the school developed, and they had a staff of
teachers, they thought it necessary not to be content with the
training they themselves could give in the school ways, but applied
to have a department for secondary teachers opened at the Home
and Colonial College. This was done solely for the benefit of
‘Miss Buss’ teachers’ at first, though others came in time.
Greatest among those others was Miss Clough.</p>

<p class='c017'>“This little history of the idea of training, as Miss Buss held it
first, is characteristic of her attitude on the subject throughout. She
thought it essential, and at the same time so great and special a
work, that it ought to be undertaken by those who made a special
business of it, and not by the heads of schools whose special
business was something else. She felt the need of it as an artist
in her work, she sought to have it supplied in the spirit of the
administrator by the foundation of institutions for it.</p>

<p class='c017'>“To these lectures Miss Buss sent all the young teachers
whom she could induce to go. Very often, I suppose, they resisted
the light, as, in the pride of youth and eagerness to be doing, they
resist the light of the training college still. In eagerness and self-confidence
I was probably equal to most, but I had been theorizing
about education on my own account, and was very sensible of the
darkness. So when she told me about the College of Preceptors
and Mr. Payne, she showed me what I was looking for, and I
eagerly accepted the suggestion of attending the lectures. She
told me afterwards how much she was pleased with my ready
interest. It was indeed at this point that our minds first met.
And perhaps this was partly why, when she brought me into the
hall to let me out herself, she first held out her hand and then
looking at me in the way her girls so well know, she suddenly took
me in her arms and kissed me. But chiefly it was an impulse of
motherly tenderness that prompted her. I was young and had
suffered.</p>

<p class='c017'>“This was in January, before school opened. In February, she
sent for me to come twice a week and teach mathematics. The
school was in 202, Camden Road, then, and there were 300 girls.
Miss Armstead and Miss Lyndon were in the first class I ever
taught. They were great friends, but had agreed not to sit together,
so that they might escape the temptation of talking. I had never
been inside a school before, and had no idea what girls other than
I had been were like intellectually. I might well feel modest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>about the need of training in the <i>technique</i> of managing a class,
the one thing in which the College of Preceptors’ lectures did not
specially help me. But the girls were very good, and did not ‘try
it on,’ with one exception, and she used to be sorry, and apologize
of her own accord. I remember being wonderfully impressed by
the high tone of feeling that prevailed, the absence of petty
jealousies, the trustworthiness of the girls, and the confidence
placed in them about marks and conduct. Over all the head-mistress
was as a second conscience. Nothing mean, petty, or
egotistic could survive contact with the fresh bracing air of her
personality. I was very new and very inexperienced in school
ways; she had her little anxieties about me, and used to look after
my classes a good deal at first. All young teachers know what
this feels like, but it was a great help none the less, and we must
all win our spurs before we get them. Except those who remained
of the original staff, I was the only teacher there who had not been
a pupil.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Soon I came for all my time, and taught German. But the
demand for mathematics grew as the teaching developed, and
before long all my teaching time was absorbed in this stricter
intellectual discipline of the North London girl. It is perhaps a
digression, but I may mention that the first genius I found was
Sara Annie Burstall. With Miss Buss as a head-mistress, and
such a pupil as that, and many more to love and help, I began to
be happy in those days.</p>

<p class='c017'>“As the school and its head became more and more to me, I
grew into that position in relation to both which enables me to
give some account of my dear friend’s mind and practice, first as
shown in the inner work of the North London Collegiate School
during these later years, and secondly in relation to the various
phases of the educational movement outside.</p>

<p class='c017'>“In the head-mistress’ room at the North London Collegiate
School there was in leisure moments always likely to be going on
discussion of many things other than the immediate business of
education in the school. It was indeed a noteworthy fact that so
much concentration of work and interest in such an effort as the
creation of this great school out of the void that preceded it, should
have gone with so wide an extension of interest in other fields, and
these not educational fields only. One delightful bond of sympathy
between Miss Buss and me was our common interest in public
affairs, and the harmony of our political opinions. How eagerly
she looked for news in stirring times! how heartily she threw herself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>into the questions of the day! and how she enjoyed a good political
discussion! She was thoroughly imbued with the fine civic spirit,
and for my part I believe this contact of her mind with the issues
of life on a larger—even though rougher—scale, was invaluable for
the health of the school-life, as a corrective to the narrow scholastic
spirit which so easily banishes the fresh air from schools, and
possibly sometimes even from universities. It is not the particular
opinions that tell, it is the contact with genuine public spirit in
any shape.</p>

<p class='c017'>“But it is with the educational interests and the outer circles
of her life in connection with them that we have here to do. In
all her work she had her eye always on the larger issues. The
North London Collegiate School was never out of perspective in
the mental picture of the educational field. No other educational
leader has worked with more devotion to one special institution,
but though it was the centre of her practical world it never usurped
the place of centre in her vision. And for this very reason it was
at the central source of many educational movements, because she
was in it, and was also at the very heart of them.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The first place among these may be given to the education of
women in all its phases. But concern for the cultivation and
spread of educational principles and the professional training of
the teacher lay scarcely less near her heart. During the later
years, this occupied even more of her attention, and she never had
‘women only’ in her mind. Then it was in the very nature of
her that she should be greatly exercised by the politico-educational
problems before they rose at all above the horizon of the regular
scholastic mind. I wonder how many schoolmasters in England
came to look into the question of Welsh Intermediate Education,
its creation and organization, when the earliest Welsh Education
Bills came before the House of Commons. But we used to discuss
these things in those days over our midday meal, and debate on
the analogy, or want of analogy, with the English problem. The
last piece of public work she did was to answer the queries sent to
educationalists by the Royal Commission on Secondary Education.
She was too ill then to give evidence before the Commission, too
ill to have answered these queries if the ideas of them had been
new to her, but she had known her mind about them clearly in the
days of her strength, and it was easy to go over familiar ground
once more. It was so familiar to her that it was familiar ground
to me too; I knew her opinions as well as I knew my own (or
better, in so far as they were more determinate).”</p>

<p class='c023'>“I have no liking for large boarding-schools. My ideal of
education is large, well-conducted day schools, with all the life
and discipline that numbers alone can give; not to speak of the
greater cheapness and efficiency of the teaching. Our young
women are narrowed sadly by the want of sympathy, large
experience, and right self-estimation which only mixing with
numbers gives. But no large dormitories nor dining-rooms. Let
the education be as broad and vivacious as may be, and to a
certain extent, public; at all events, public-spirited. But, if
boarders must attend, let them live in families, under proper
regulations, of course, and attend as day scholars. Large boarding-schools
give a sort of hardness, which I, for one, greatly dislike.
They destroy the home-feelings, but I need not dwell on these
points; my feelings are most in favour of day schools and good
homes.</p>
<p class='c017'>“We have two boarding-houses. One, my own, is of very
recent establishment—the girls go to and from school with me or
an assistant-governess. Their education is just the same as that
of all the day pupils.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It is right, however, to say that this plan of letting the
mistress receive boarders is not allowed at the Cheltenham
Ladies’ College, a large and successful institution, the only (almost)
efficient proprietary girls’ school in this country. I can see
possible evils, but as I have only just begun, am not fully aware
of them yet. I should not recommend, I think, the mistress of a
great day school being allowed to begin with a boarding-house.
Her strength and whole working time ought to go to the school.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>So wrote Miss Buss in 1868. She had taken Myra
Lodge because she could not otherwise have carried
out her great scheme. She afterwards came to see
more clearly still that the head of a great school ought
to have her time at home free from all claims. Had
she been able to act on this from the first, her own life
might have been prolonged. But once having taken
up the life at Myra she could never bring herself to let
the girls go. Even when, at last, she handed the
boarding-house over to Miss Edwards, she moved to
the house adjoining, and had a door left so that she
could have girls to see her or go to see them. She
said: “I do not think I could now be quite happy
without girls round me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In accordance with her own theories, she tried to
make Myra Lodge as home-like as possible. And the
welfare of her girls—physical, mental, and spiritual—was
her first care. To hygiene she had paid special
attention, and her arrangements for ventilation, bathing,
and food, left nothing to be desired. She always laid
great stress on the need of sufficient food, varied in
every possible way; and every one within her range
must have heard her expatiate on the folly, or wickedness,
for she gave it the harder term, which induces so
many young women to do fatal injury to their health
by insufficient and unsuitable food. Of the laziness
and indifference which makes so many of them content
with odd cups of tea, in place of regular and proper
meals, she could not speak too strongly. The Myra
girls were fed well, and with sufficient luxuries to make
“home hampers” unnecessary.</p>

<p class='c006'>On all sides we hear of the special care exercised in
the matter of proper food during examinations, or in
any time of extra strain. If it was known that the
interval during an examination was too brief to allow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>of a full meal, hot soup, or hot milk, with bread and
butter, or scone, would be ready at the right time.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here is a word to the point from Miss Buss, to
whom I had mentioned some child’s complaint against
a teacher—</p>

<p class='c014'>“If there is anything wrong, I will see to it, but, meantime, I
cannot but think there is as much <i>real</i> foundation for this charge
against Miss S. as there is in the one against me, which has taken
much of my time this week to trace out, viz. that a girl now in
school, was removed from my house, and placed under medical
treatment, because of the <i>insufficiency of food</i>.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It is quite impossible to trust in children’s judgments until
all sides of the question are looked into. Their views are as
immature as their bodies.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Another child speaks in the same way of another teacher, and
I am constantly having to bring in floods of light on a girl.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Suitable clothing was also a matter of careful consideration.
Miss Buss would have liked a school-uniform,
which she would have made graceful as well
as rational; but, except in the gymnasium, she never
attained this desire, and had to content herself with at
school advising, and at Myra compelling, the most
needful reforms. She waged war against unsuitable
ornamentation, lace and jewellery in the morning being
always attacked.</p>

<p class='c006'>She would, if possible, have given each girl a separate
room, well supplied with the “place for everything,” in
which everything would be expected to be in its place.
Failing this, she so divided the rooms by curtains that
each inmate secured one portion that was specially
her own.</p>

<p class='c006'>At one time it was rather a fashion to talk of the
“over-work” at Miss Buss’ schools. Doubtless there
were cases of girls too delicate for the life of a public
school, who ought to have been kept at home; and
there were also cases—very numerous—in which girls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>who were expected to do school-work and at the same
time meet every home claim, as well as enjoy social
distractions and dissipations, certainly did suffer. But
at Myra Lodge, where life was duly regulated, and the
time for study fixed to suit each girl, no one suffered
who was at all fit to be away from her mother’s care,
whilst many were very markedly improved in health
during their stay there.</p>

<p class='c006'>Having myself suffered, for life, from the ignorance
of the laws of health common to even the most intellectually
advanced teachers of my youth, I was interested
in this question, and often talked it over with Miss Buss.
Looking back on my own experience, and contrasting
it with what I knew of the arrangements at Myra, I
could never bring myself to believe in the sufferings of
girls enjoying the benefit of Miss Buss’ thorough knowledge
of hygiene.</p>

<p class='c006'>She fully endorsed the opinion expressed by Miss
Beale, in an able paper read before the Social Science
Congress, in 1874, where she says—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I remember the outcry raised when it was proposed to open
the local examinations to girls. The deed was done, and none of
the evils predicted have fallen on us. I frequently challenge our
visitors to find a delicate-looking girl among our students. I do
not say we have none, but there are so few that it is not easy to
find them. I kept, one year, a record of all the causes of absence,
and found that in the higher classes pupils were absent from
illness on an average about three days in a year, in the lower from
five to six, and in the lowest rather more.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And from America comes the satisfactory report
of “headaches diminishing and hysteria disappearing
under the strengthening influences on body and mind
of this higher education.”</p>

<p class='c006'>There is no doubt that the pupils of the North
London Collegiate Schools had enough to do. But I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>know of at least two cases where the complaint was
quite the other way. Miss Buss says in one note—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Fancy Mr. ——! He also wrote last year objecting to his
daughter’s home-work being limited. I know that most of the
Myra girls finish at seven o’clock, do no lessons before nine in the
morning, do <i>none at all</i> on Friday evening, and always put every
bit of school-work by on Saturday at twelve. This leaves many
an hour free. But parents are the weakest of mortals. Unmarried
‘<i>Arnies</i>’ have <i>will</i>, and <i>carry out</i> what they know to be right!”</p>

<p class='c005'>In another case a pupil was withdrawn from Myra
Lodge because she was not allowed to work beyond the
allotted time. Miss Buss writes in reference to this—</p>

<p class='c014'>“The child thinks she will be allowed, I suppose, to study
whatever hours she likes, if she goes elsewhere. <i>I</i> will not allow
more than a certain amount. What’s not done then, must be left
undone. The consequence is, mental as well as bodily activity,
in time.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Later, she again refers to the same subject: “Patty
Watson has left me. It is a good lesson of failure, and
helps, let us hope, to repress that ‘bladder of elation’ of
which you speak.” And, once again, apropos to some
other difficulty: “The enclosed note is very satisfactory.
J—— D—— was not allowed to go her own way, like
Patty, who, by the way, is a clever girl, conscientious
and industrious.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It may be open to question, perhaps, whether Miss
Buss might not have relaxed her rules in favour of this
very remarkable girl. But it is also probable that the
very perception of the dangers attending overstrain may
have made her resolute against it. Miss Ellen Martha
Watson had gone to Myra Lodge, mainly that she
might pursue study in higher mathematics, and consequently
might have expected to count as more than
an ordinary schoolgirl. She was, however, of highly
sensitive organization, and no one who knows the care
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>exercised over each girl individually can doubt that
Miss Buss was aware of all that concerned her, and
judged accordingly.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Watson gained first-class honours in the Senior
Cambridge Local Examination while at Myra Lodge.
Afterwards, at the University College Intermediate, she
took the highest prize for applied mathematics and
mechanics, as well as a £50 Scholarship. Professor
Clifford said on this occasion that the proficiency of
Miss Watson would have been very rare in a man, but
he had been utterly unprepared to find it in a woman,
adding that, “a few more students like Miss Watson
would raise University College to a status far surpassing
that of institutions twenty times as rich and two
hundred times longer in existence.”</p>

<p class='c006'>A case so exceptional must stand alone; but still
the question does suggest itself, if, throughout her
whole school-life, Miss Watson had been subject to
the restrictions judged wholesome by one so wise as
Miss Buss, might she not possibly have been spared to
work out her splendid destiny, instead of being so early
laid to rest in her lonely South African grave?</p>

<p class='c006'>It is impossible to form any rules which will include
the few brilliant exceptions who are a law to themselves;
such, for example, as Miss Cobbe, one out of a
thousand, in being endowed with a physique to match
her mental vigour, who gives an instance of the kind
of work possible to herself. She is contrasting the old
and the new order of things, or <i>impulse</i> versus <i>system</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I can make no sort of pretensions to have acquired, even in
my best days, anything like the instruction which the young
students of Girton and Newnham and Lady Margaret Hall are
so fortunate as to possess; and much I envy their opportunities
for acquiring accurate scholarship. But I know not whether the
method they follow can, on the whole, convey as much of the pure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>delight of learning as did my solitary early studies. When the
summer morning sun rose over the trees and shone into my bedroom,
finding me still over my books from the evening before, and
when I then sauntered out to take a sleep on one of the garden-seats
in the shrubbery, the sense of having learnt something, or
cleared up some hitherto doubted point, or added a store of fresh
ideas to my mental riches, was of purest satisfaction.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Without coming to any final decision on the best
mode of dealing with genius, to which study after this
fashion may be natural, we may at least safely conclude
that even in the most elastic of school boarding-houses,
a girl so expansive could scarcely find herself
happy, or be a source of happiness to the anxious
mistress.</p>

<p class='c006'>But how happy even a very clever girl might be at
Myra we may see from some memories of a stay of
six months, spent in preparation for Girton, where the
writer, Mrs. Lewis, distinguished herself—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I remember, as if it was yesterday, my first meeting with
Miss Buss, now twenty-three years ago.... At the earliest
possible moment she had interviewed me privately, and I was
deeply impressed by her earnest manner, by the thoroughness
with which she went into my former education, and the evident
intention of doing her utmost for me. This I soon knew was
characteristic of her. We were, to her, individuals—each one the
object of genuine interest and real anxiety....</p>

<p class='c017'>“She talked to me more as an adult than as a schoolgirl, and
I remember with gratitude that she invited me to walk with her to
church, or on any occasion when she happened to go out with us,
interesting me in some social, educational, or philanthropic subject,
talking with such fluency and such a fund of illustration and of
racy anecdote that I was sorry when our destination was reached.
Looking back, I realize what an unusually generous thing it was
for all these privileges to be poured out on a raw schoolgirl, and,
moreover, on a stranger. That eager, ungrudging, self-spending
for others was, to my mind, the most noticeable feature of dear
Miss Buss’ daily life.</p>

<p class='c017'>“In about two months Miss Buss began actively arranging for
me to see as much of London as possible during my stay with her.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>With all the varied work and cares of her busy days upon her, she
would constantly ask, ‘Had I seen this place of interest? had I
heard that famous preacher? had I ever been so-and-so?’ And every
spare afternoon or evening was used to the best advantage, either
personally, or with any lady she could find free to chaperone me.
She often told me that a teacher ought to have as wide and varied
an experience as possible, and all the general information she
could get, and should never think that book-learning alone would
fit her for her post. Foreign travel, social intercourse, general
reading, all were insisted on as indispensable. And she would
give me bits of the history of her own struggles....</p>

<p class='c017'>“The happiness of all her pupils was to her an object of real
solicitude. I remember my delighted surprise on one of the first
Saturdays at her cheery invitation, ‘Now, girls, which of you
would like to come to see Maccabe, at St. George’s Hall, with me
this afternoon?’ I knew the week had been a very busy one, and
I wondered how Miss Buss could find the energy to be so gay,
and to laugh with the merriest of us at the jokes.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Looking back, I realize that I cannot over-estimate the value
of such association with that noble, earnest, sympathetic nature.
And, certainly, I have never seen any one who so equally combined
earnestness of purpose, untiring industry, indomitable perseverance,
and shrewd common sense, with the perfection of
womanly sympathy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Of the intellectually stimulating effect of this
association another pupil speaks strongly—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Although it is quite impossible for any of us to measure the
great influence for good that Miss Buss has exerted over the whole
of our lives, in one particular I have specially felt the great help
her training has been to me personally, viz. the choice of books
and taste for good literature.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I can remember, quite early in my school-life, the cutting
satire with which Miss Buss would criticize some of the modern
trash in the shape of literature, so that one felt (and that feeling I
have never lost) one simply could not read such books. On the
other hand, she always recommended plenty of good wholesome
books to help us in the choice of our reading; while, in pointing
out passages, or in explaining allusions, she roused interest, and
cultivated the taste for all that is good and pure in literature.</p>

<p class='c017'>“She applied to books, as to other things, her favourite motto:
‘Aim high, and you will strike high!’</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>“She seemed, in all her teaching, to agree with the poet
Lowell, that ‘not failure, but low aim, is crime!’</p>

<p class='c017'>“A favourite subject for debate was the <i>Ethics of Waste</i>,
showing that everything wantonly destroyed is a loss to the community.
The wickedness of waste of food seems to have excited
much attention, and set the girls, among themselves, to discuss
and make calculations concerning it which served—as they were
meant to do—to give safe and harmless topics for talk.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Akin to this was the effort to make girls look into the future,
and not to trust to what might happen, but to prepare by present
action in acquiring habits of decision and industry. She thought
that every woman should be independent, and deprecated dependence
on brothers or other friends, so long as effort was possible
on their own part.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Another “Myra girl” seizes on a point very
characteristic, when she says—</p>

<p class='c014'>“To schoolgirl and friend alike, Miss Buss was entirely
natural. She was too great to think of, or to need, exterior aids to
respect. Forgetful of herself, she was ever ready to share her
thoughts or memories with all who could be interested or helped
by them.</p>

<p class='c017'>“In her conversation she avoided all personal gossip. Never
did an unkind or hasty word about a fellow-being cross her lips,
and often in the school addresses, she told us that by chatter the
ninth commandment was easily broken, and that topics about
acquaintances begun in innocence, ended only in harm and hurt
to others.”</p>

<p class='c005'>There is a story of her that, one day, after a visitor
had gone, Miss Buss seemed very uncomfortable, and
finally said, “I feel as if I had been stung all over;
that talk has left so many stings behind it!” It was
her rule, carefully kept, never to repeat unpleasant
things; but she never forgot to mention any kind word
said about others.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Fawcett speaks of Miss Buss’ sympathy with
young life and its needs, and she adds—</p>

<p class='c014'>“The girls were a great happiness to Miss Buss. If one or
other did give trouble through temper—and this did worry her—we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>would sometimes comfort each other by reflecting how many of
them did nothing of the kind, but went on tranquilly and happily.
‘Yes,’ she would say, ‘it is the old story; the ninety and nine are
apt to be forgotten in the struggle with the one!’ And she would
cheer up.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She was very indulgent to her girls at the half-term
holidays. Besides sending them for pleasant excursions,
she liked them to be able to go into the kitchen to
make toffee, and to cook some little dainty (Northcountry
cakes or specialities), or anything else they
might like.</p>

<p class='c006'>The girls’ birthdays were always marked by some
special treat. On one occasion we hear that the younger
children were, for once, to be allowed to make “just
as much noise as they liked.” The results were so
“tremendous” that a friendly policeman looked in to
see if his services were required, greatly relieved to find
that the shrieks which had attracted him were only
shrieks of laughter.</p>

<p class='c006'>But, whilst delighting in real fun, the line was drawn,
hard and fast, at slang, roughness, and, above all, at
practical jokes. No girl who had once had a talk with
her on this last topic was likely to make a second
attempt within reach of Miss Buss. The doings of
certain “smart” sets found small tolerance in her eyes.
Nor did the “Dodo” and “Yellow Aster” literature
fare better, though for most of it she would have
probably given the prescription that worked so well in
one particular case of morbid excitement—“closed doors
and open windows,” or silence and fresh air.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Buss had remarked, as a fact of her experience,
that if girls of great natural vanity could not take the
lead in any other way, they developed something sensational
in health. Hearing of a case of this sort in
one of the boarding-houses, she requested to be sent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>for if another fainting fit should come on. This was
done. On arriving, she found the girls’ room full of
anxious bystanders, who were at once dismissed, only
excepting the head of the house, who was asked to
close the door and open all the windows.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Buss then demanded a large jug of “the very
coldest water that could be procured,” adding, in
distinct tones, “There is no sort of danger in this
kind of attack, and the most certain cure is a sudden
dash of very cold water in the face.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In telling me this story, she added, with one of her
most genial smiles—</p>

<p class='c006'>“I saw that the child had her best frock on, and
I wanted to give her time.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Before the water came, the patient was able to gasp
out, “Ah, I feel better now, thank you!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is right, my child. I am glad you feel better.
And now remember, in future, that you need never
alarm either yourself or any one else. If you feel a
little faintness coming on, just retire to your own room,
without saying anything about it. Shut your door,
open all the windows, and lie down quietly. You will
soon find yourself well again.”</p>

<p class='c006'>There was no recurrence of the attack.</p>

<p class='c006'>With weakness of will Miss Buss could by nature
have little sympathy. But she was stern only when she
knew that a will might be roused to greater effort,
which, if let alone, could only grow more and more
feeble. With merely morbid and self-centred natures
she had still less affinity, and for these the prescription,
“Do your next duty first!” would be very strongly
enforced.</p>

<p class='c006'>Coldness or extreme reserve of manner was always
a trial to Miss Buss, as to all persons of a naturally demonstrative
temperament. It was true that she herself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>sometimes exercised a repressive influence, but this was
only when she was very much run down or worried.
Usually, she drew people out by her frank kindness.
One of her very favourite stories for her girls was
Mrs. Gatty’s charming kitten story, “Purr when you
are pleased!” She liked every one to show feelings
of pleasure or kindness, and in this she set them a
bright example.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Fawcett recalls, among many things bearing
on the same point, a remark made to her by Miss Buss,
as they passed two new girls—both of whom are since
known to fame—“It is always a refreshment of spirit
to me to look at those two happy sisters!” Natures
of this kind were a real help in her times of depression
or discouragement, though, doubtless, none of the girls
ever dreamt that one so strong could need help. Other
teachers will understand from experience this joy of
whole-hearted and sympathetic obedience from their
pupils. And it is easy to measure what this must have
been to Miss Buss in those later days, when she was
no longer the energetic young teacher, sweeping every
one along with her in a rapture of devotion, but, instead,
had to carry, in addition to her own inevitable burdens,
all the cares of her wide public work.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may be a direct result of public-school life, assimilating
the modern girl to her schoolboy brother, but
certainly it is to be observed that the High-school girl
rarely seems to have that power of expressing her
feelings which made her mother or grandmother so
much easier in all social relations. It is more than
probable that, in thus growing like the typical “schoolboy,”
she may in reality feel more, and not less, from
this very habit of repression. But the fact remains
that she is more difficult of approach than the girl of
other days.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>With special cases quite individual in their nature,
Miss Buss was rarely known to fail. As one of her
staff observes—</p>

<p class='c014'>“the way in which she managed difficult and obstinate pupils
was marvellous. She would spend hours with them, and never
thought the time wasted if at last she made the slightest impression.
Often, when this did not appear on the surface, it was shown weeks,
months, or even years after, by some little note or message.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In thanking a young friend for some proof of affection
there is a pathetic little appeal—</p>

<p class='c014'>“You <i>young</i> people can form no idea—till your time comes—of
how much pain a little indifference can inflict, especially when
both the old and the young have warm hearts. My life needs close
love from some one—I have given a large amount of mine to some
one—and when he not only responds, but initiates loving remarks
or caresses, he fills the old person’s heart with warmth, brightness,
and love.”</p>

<p class='c005'>On some few occasions, when more than usually
overdone, I have heard Miss Buss admit with a weary
sigh that she found the girls of the last decade of her
work so much less easy to influence than those of the
first; since, even when they were inwardly touched,
they seemed unable to show it after the old fashion.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Autres temps, autres mœurs.</i>” But yet, making all
due allowance, if these “difficult” girls could have seen
this friend after one of the encounters so terrible to her,
and have realized how spent and heart-sick she was,
they must have taken less pride in their defiance or
hardness. She cared for them so deeply that it was
real anguish of soul to her to think of the future
sorrows inevitable for tempers undisciplined and wills
unsubdued.</p>

<p class='c006'>With this question of the influence on manners of
the public school comes what does seem a real
objection to the new development—an objection most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>strongly felt by those who look farthest back. With
her invariable point and terseness, Miss Cobbe thus
puts this matter in a nutshell—</p>

<p class='c014'>“William of Wykeham’s motto: ‘Manners makyth Manne,’
was understood to hold good emphatically concerning the making
of Woman. The abrupt-speaking, courtesy-neglecting, slouching,
slangy young damsel, who may now perhaps carry off the glories
of a University degree, would then have seemed still needing to
be taught the very rudiments of feminine knowledge. When I
recall the type of perfect womanly gentleness and high breeding
which then and there was formed, it seems to me as if, in comparison,
modern manners are all rough and brusque. We have
graceful women in abundance still, but the peculiar, old-fashioned
suavity, the tact which made every one in a company happy and
at ease—most of all, the humblest individual present—and which
at the same time, effectually prevented the most audacious from
transgressing <i>les bienséances</i> by a hair; of that suavity and tact
we seem to have lost the tradition.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But Miss Buss had always faith enough in the future
to regard the modern roughness as merely a transitional
stage, and as the outcome, in the first place, of the higher
standard of morals which places <i>fact</i> before <i>seeming</i>.
The perfect outward grace of the courtly days did not
always imply corresponding grace within. When these
first days of reaction shall pass, and a really wide and
high culture shall have become general, we may expect
the development of a new gracefulness which shall be
the genuine outcome of a truly gracious spirit.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“For manners are not idle, but the fruit</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Of loyal nature, and of noble mind.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>In the very early days at Myra, the rules were few
and simple, and the girls were trusted to do the right
for love of it. Miss Buss believed in the force of a
strong public opinion which should put all wrong-doing
in its true light as hurtful to the community; and she
considered it the chief advantage of a large public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>school that a strong feeling for the right should prevail,
and, by its very force, put down all that was base or
ignoble.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was a grief to her to make new rules, and I can
recall her sorrow, on several occasions, when it became
necessary to add to those already existing—in every
case as the result of some act on the part of a selfish
minority, who thus imposed additional burdens on the
obedient majority.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Fawcett, who had long experience at Myra,
and Miss Edwards, who followed her there, speak very
strongly about the thoughtful care which in all cases
aimed at preventing possible dangers. Girls whose
influence might be hurtful to each other were placed
in rooms remote; and the sitting-rooms were made
attractive, and thus kept the pupils to some extent
under constant supervision.</p>

<p class='c006'>In Miss Buss’ letters during the holidays there are
many proofs of this thoughtfulness. She writes to Miss
Fawcett—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Of these two I know nothing—morally, I mean. But A.
ought to be kept if possible from B., and also from C. and D.; the
former cannot manage her, and the latter gives in, perhaps, to
her. Would it do for her to take F.’s bed, in G.’s room? It requires
consideration.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This consideration reached all round. Another long
letter goes into arrangements for Miss Fawcett’s own
relief from some of the care, each detail being worked
out with the utmost exactness.</p>

<p class='c006'>Or again—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Can you invite X. to visit you on the half-term holiday, or, if
possible, from Friday or Saturday before? I fear she may be
asked to two places where I do not wish her to go just now. She
is not easy to manage, and her companions are of great importance;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>and yet it is difficult for me to decline invitations when the reason
cannot be explained.</p>

<p class='c017'>“If you do not much mind, I will not send the three girls on
Sunday until six o’clock, when they will be in time for service,
unless it is raining.</p>

<p class='c017'>“But <i>I</i> give up an hour or rather more to the girls on Sunday
afternoons, and have been obliged, since that difficulty last year,
to refuse to let them out on Sundays, except at the half-term. If
by any chance a girl goes out in the morning, I expect her back to
tea. They can go out on Saturday afternoons occasionally.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Here is a note after the great explosion in Regent’s
Park, on October 2nd, 1874—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I hope nothing worse than broken glass has happened at your
house in consequence of the terrible shock this morning. Thirteen
of my windows are shattered, but I am too thankful for the preservation
of the young inmates of my house to mind anything.</p>

<p class='c017'>“My first thought was that the stack of chimneys had blown
down, and, in falling, had crushed the roof in on the beds of Mary
and Ethel P—— and Edith A——. The noise seemed to come
from that quarter. In an instant I was upstairs, to ascertain if
they were safe.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I find myself even now shaking from the shock to the nervous
system. My girls behaved admirably. They were all quiet.”</p>

<p class='c005'>From the early days to the latest Miss Buss gave
short addresses weekly on some moral text, choosing
frequently some recent story of great deed or high
thought, and making it interesting as she brought it to
bear on the daily life of the girls. As one of the staff
remarks—</p>

<p class='c014'>“The high moral tone of the school was materially helped by
these weekly addresses. Four forms met her in the Lecture Hall,
and teachers and pupils listened to her wise counsel. One of her
favourite texts was the life of Dorothy Wordsworth, as she
earnestly pleaded with the girls, above all things, to aim at being
true women, and not to let their school-work in any way interfere
with their home duties, never forgetting that they must bring either
sunshine or cloud into the home-life.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>Here is a little sketch of the Sunday talks at
Myra—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I love to picture that drawing-room, Miss Buss to the left of
the fire, her lamp on the table at her right, and the girls grouped
around her at the fire, often some at her feet.... I never heard
any one read as she did, and especially on those Sundays! Every
word told. And then she would pause, and send some truth home
by an illustration from her own experience.... After the holidays,
she was generally full of some new thought: Mrs. Norton’s ‘Lady
of La Garaye’ was brought after a happy holiday at Dinan....
She spent hours in the preparation of the Myra and school
addresses, a testimony to the stress she laid on their importance.”</p>

<p class='c005'>There are some pretty little glimpses of the inner
life at Myra, given by a pupil who spent there a somewhat
prolonged school-life, in which she came into very
close relation to the beloved teacher—</p>

<p class='c014'>“My earliest recollection of Miss Buss was when I went in for
the entrance exam.; in a state of great trepidation, I accompanied
her along the corridor to take off my things, and I think she saw
my poor fingers shaking, for she suddenly took me in her warm
embrace, and said, ‘Do your best, my dear child, and you must
leave the rest,’ and then, looking me in the face, with another kiss,
she said, ‘I <i>think</i> we are going to be friends.’ And the radiant
smile that accompanied the kiss won my heart and banished
my fears.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I had been at Myra Lodge only a few weeks when, one of the
girls having acted contrary to regulations, a warm discussion on
her conduct took place in the playroom downstairs, some defending
and some disapproving of her conduct. We were quite unaware
that in the heat of discussion our voices were loud enough
to be heard upstairs; it was a point on which I felt strongly, and
I expressed myself somewhat emphatically for a new-comer. The
next day Miss Buss sent for me, said she knew of the incident, and
‘you said so-and-so, my child; I am delighted to think you feel in
that way, you were on the right side, and remember, dear, I shall
always <i>expect</i> to find you on the right side.’ How often that belief
in my being ‘on the right side’ helped me to make the struggle for
the right only <i>I</i> can tell!”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>The same writer gives a glimpse of the brightest
side of the relation between the head and her Myra
girls—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Miss Buss would often come round and see we were quite
comfortable in our beds, and give us a maternal ‘tuck-up.’ One
morning at breakfast she came behind my chair, and, turning my
chin up with her hand to look in my face, said with laughing voice
and eye—</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Well, did I cheat you last night?’</p>

<p class='c017'>“A vision of a figure in red dressing-gown tucking me up and
kissing me sprang into my mind, and I said—</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Oh, I remember; I thought it was mother.’</p>

<p class='c017'>“And, whispering to me, she said, as she kissed me, ‘I thought
so, dear; you gave me such a hug, you sent me so happy to bed!’”</p>

<p class='c005'>And this, again, from another old pupil, is equally
attractive—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Never shall I forget her kindness when confined to my room
at Myra by illness. It was the bright spot in my day when Miss
Buss appeared in the evening to tuck me up in bed, and wish me
good night. More than once she was on her way to some dinner
or meeting, and wore a blue <i>moiré</i>, which I thought singularly
becoming. Her smile, peculiarly sweet, piquant, and gracious,
lighted up my long, dull hours, and lingers with me still.</p>

<p class='c017'>“There was something so large and unfluctuating about her
that one felt one could trust her with and through everything.”</p>

<p class='c005'>An apparently harmless bit of nonsense brought
about another episode which deeply impressed the girl
who tells it—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Miss Buss was in her little room. In her kindest way she
held out her hand to me and said—</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Dear child, I want to talk to you; did you write that?’
producing the book.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Oh yes,’ I laughed, ‘just to tease Louie!’</p>

<p class='c017'>“I shall never forget the way in which she drew me to her, put
my head on her shoulder, and then talked to me. She pointed out
that the offence in itself was not a serious one, but that the jesting
with a subject so serious as Love was one that no girl should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>indulge in; and then followed the most beautiful little picture of
what true earthly love might be, that makes me glow to think of
now, and she urged me never to trifle with the subject in any
form, reserving all my ‘best’ for the one who was to give me ‘what
is God’s best gift on earth, dear, the love of a good man, such as
the love your father and mother have, and such as I hope He may
give you.’ How glad I am to think she <i>knew</i> I have received
that gift!”</p>

<p class='c005'>It must indeed have been a joy to this happy young
wife to be able often to brighten the later days of the
solitary worker, whom she mourns now with tender and
grateful remembrance in words that find far echoes—</p>

<p class='c014'>“You know my deep affection, I may truly say veneration, for
the dear one, and I feel as if one of my very nearest had gone.
I look on it as one of the greatest privileges of my life to have
lived in such close contact with her for so many years. Dear, dear
Miss Buss, what an inspiration she has been, and what a responsibility
rests with us to carry out what she has always taught us as
the ideal of life! Her influence in the world is untold; and I am
sure many are the lives she has influenced in critical times when
the thought of what <i>she</i> would do, or would wish, has turned the
scale in the right direction.”</p>

</div>
<p class='c014'>“The vocation of a teacher is an awful one. You cannot do her real
good; she will do others unspeakable harm if she is not aware of its awfulness.
Merely to supply her with necessaries, merely to assist her in
procuring them for herself—though that is far better, because in so doing
you awaken energy of character, reflection, providence—is not fitting her
for her work; you may confirm her in the notion that the training an
immortal spirit may be just as lawfully undertaken in a case of emergency
as that of selling ribbons? How can you give a woman self-respect, how
can you win for her the respect of others, in whom such a notion, or any
modification of it dwells? Your business is, by all means, to dispossess
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>her of it; to make her feel the greatness of her work, and yet show her
that it can be honestly performed.”—<span class='sc'>F. D. Maurice</span>, Lecture on opening
Queen’s College.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is always of interest to compare dreams with deeds,
the ideal with the actual. And this we are enabled to
do with regard to Miss Buss’ educational ideals, since
we have first her own words at different stages in her
work, before any change was made, as well as during
the time of transition; and afterwards, from a keen
observer, we have a summary of results, and see how
the dream had become fact, how the aim was attained.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is very little of Miss Buss’ writing to be found
in print. But we have one letter written, in 1868, to a
lady in Otago, and published in a colonial paper, which
gives us her ideas and her aims for future work just
before the great change.</p>

<div class='c024'>“North London Collegiate School for Ladies,</div>
<div class='c039'>“12, Camden Street,</div>
<div class='c039'>“Nov. 13, 1868.</div>
<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Madam</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“I have read with much pleasure your interesting
account of the progress of education in your colony. You will
soon leave the old country behind if you go so rapidly. There is
much to be done before it can be said that England has a great
national system of education....</p>

<p class='c017'>“Lord Lyttelton has taken a deep interest in education, and
has especially devoted himself to the consideration of the question
in relation to girls. If you have not seen it, I recommend to your
notice the Report of the Schools Inquiry Commission presented to
the Imperial Parliament at the beginning of this year. It forms
the first of a series of twenty-one Blue books, all of which are
interesting for all who care for middle-class education. The
chapter on the education of girls was, I believe, written by Lord
Lyttelton.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The school of which I am head-mistress was opened eighteen
years ago, under the immediate patronage of the local clergy. The
girls’ school followed almost immediately the opening of a boys’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>school, which has numbered about four hundred for some years
past. Both schools have from the first been entirely self-supporting.
The girls have, however, outgrown their accommodation in two
good-sized houses, but will, I trust, in time be located in a suitable
building. The schools have always been conducted on what is
here called the ‘conscience clause’; that is, the parents have the
right of omitting the Church of England Catechism or any part of
the religious teaching they object to. Even Jewesses<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c018'><sup>[9]</sup></a> have
received their whole education in the school.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The routine of English has been considerably improved by
the extension to girls’ schools of the Cambridge Local Examinations.
It is impossible, I think, to overrate the good already done
in girls’ schools by these examinations. A definite standard is
given, there is no undue publicity, but schools are able to measure
their teaching by the opinions of unknown and, therefore, impartial
examiners.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I cannot, of course, judge of the wants of a new colony, but
my experience goes to show that it is better to include in the
routine of study all the necessary branches, and I think a second
language is one. It is almost impossible to teach English well
unless another language is studied with it, and that other language
should be Latin, or French, or German. Of course I do not say
that this should be taught in the elementary stages, but I should
not allow parents to have the power of stopping the teaching on
the ground of extra expense.</p>

<p class='c017'>“We teach French, really, I think, allowing no option. Latin
also in the higher classes, with little or no option, except in the
case of delicate girls.</p>

<p class='c017'>“After my many years of work, if I were now to found a school
for what might be called the middle section (and, indeed, the
upper section also) of the middle-class, I should include all that I
have mentioned, viz. English thoroughly, with Elementary Science
in courses such as I have alluded to, French, Latin, bold outline
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>drawing, careful part singing, <i>plain</i> needlework, and thorough
arithmetic, with geometry and algebra in the higher classes. I
would rigidly and entirely omit all arrangements for teaching
instrumental music, which I believe to be the bane of girls’ schools,
in the time wasted and the expense entailed. I have omitted, I
see, harmony, by which I mean the laws of musical construction,
an interesting, and, in an educational point of view, a most useful
subject for mental training. Instrumental music—the piano chiefly—might
fairly be left to a private teacher, as might dancing also.
In Germany, I think, instrumental music is never taught in the
<i>Tochter Schule</i>, but is always left to private teaching.</p>

<p class='c017'>“No school ought to omit <i>physical training</i>—that is, Calisthenics,
or something equivalent. This we have of late enforced
among the elder girls. Our system, an American idea, called
Musical Gymnastics, is excellent. Easy, graceful, and not too
fatiguing, gently calling every part of the body into play by bright
spirited music, which cultivates rhythm of movement, it has
become popular, and has wonderfully improved the figure and
carriage of the girls. Our exercises last from twenty minutes to
half an hour almost daily—as much as we can manage, always four
days out of five.”</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f9'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r9'>9</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A letter from an old Jewish pupil, in the <i>Jewish Chronicle</i>, is full of
deepest regret for her loss, giving many instances of special kindnesses
received by the writer. “She was so strictly just that she gave every
consideration to the first Jewish pupil who wished to participate in the
honours not then open to Jews, acknowledging to that same pupil in after
years that she gave the consideration in justice only, for, if anything, she
was slightly prejudiced against a race she had only read about and not
known.”</p>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Miss Buss then goes on to explain fully her ideal of
what the education of girls should be, giving her
preference for “large day schools, with all the life and
discipline that numbers only can give; not to speak of
the greater efficiency and cheapness of the teaching.”
She thinks that “our young women are narrowed sadly
by want of the sympathy, large experience, and right
self-estimation which only mixing with numbers gives.”
She sees that the head of the school should be a woman,
“left free to work the school, on certain conditions,
without a committee of management.” The buildings,
of course, “should be vested in a body of trustees, of
which some should be women.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It has sometimes been urged as a reproach that
Miss Buss employed women-teachers in preference to
men. That she employed women wherever it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>possible is certain, because she considered teaching a
legitimate occupation for women, and set herself to fit
them for the work. That women <i>could</i> teach, she knew
from her own experience. That they should teach
better in the future than they had ever done in the past
was one of her steady aims, and one that she attained.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here is a strong expression of her feeling when she
first read the report of the Edinburgh Merchants’ Company’s
Schools, in 1872—</p>

<p class='c014'>“The report is interesting, but I absolutely burn with indignation
(does not my atrocious handwriting bear witness to it?) at
the bare notion of <i>men</i> teachers in the upper girls’ schools. It is
shameful, costly (because some poor drudge of a woman must
accept starvation pay, in order to maintain decorum by being
present at every master’s lesson), and it is degrading to women’s
education. How can girls value it, when they see that no amount
of it will make a woman fit to teach them, except as infants.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Don’t be frightened, I feel well and even amiable, though I
am in a great hurry, and my hand aches.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Her own deliberate opinion on this matter is expressed
in the letter to her colonial correspondent—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Although I advocate certain teaching being given by men to
the elder girls, it does not seem desirable that the head of a girls’
school should be a man. There are many things in the training of
a young woman which cannot be enforced by a man, or even by
a woman whose position does not carry the weight of authority.
Women, also, teach young and ignorant children better than men,
their patience and sympathy being greater. On the other hand,
it is highly desirable, when girls are beyond the drudgery of school-work,
that their minds should be touched by men. A certain fibre
seems to be given by this means. At present women’s ignorance
prevents them from giving the highest kind of teaching, but a
brighter day is dawning for them I trust.”</p>

<p class='c005'>All through her career, Miss Buss arranged for good
lectures from men, as well as from women, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>regular religious instruction was always given by a
clergyman. In early days there were courses of lectures
by Dr. Hodgson and Mr. Payne. There were lectures on
literature from French and German professors, in their
own tongues. At one time the girls would be entranced
by glimpses of the starry heavens from Mr. Proctor;
at another, they were ready, <i>en masse</i>, to follow Captain
Wiggins through the perils of the Arctic seas, to Siberia.
In brief, these extra lectures included every possible
subject that could tend to culture, in history, travels,
art, or social matters.</p>

<p class='c006'>How Miss Bass advanced in educational theory is
shown in extracts from her letters in 1872, just after
the private school had been made public, and while the
work of organization was still going on—</p>

<p class='c014'>“When we are once fairly started, matters will go on more
easily. The anxiety over money will go, for instance. After next
year, the public meeting will go, I hope. Then I may devote
myself to the inside of the school.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I want to train up girl-students in <i>science</i>; I want to teach
music grandly—thoroughly in classes—making each girl understand
what she plays, as well as if she were reading some passage of
poetry, teaching her to find out the musician’s thought; <i>his</i> mode
of expressing it; other ways of expression of the same thought,
viz. <i>words</i>. The grammar of music should be known to every
musician.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Of course, only some girls would <i>fully</i> benefit by this teaching,
but all who were taught would get some good. In this last point
Miss Maclean, now Mrs. G. Fraser, will help. Indeed, she will
carry out my idea thoroughly.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c018'><sup>[10]</sup></a> We must have a room with four
pianos to begin with, and increase to six, or eight, if necessary.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>“In science Mr. Aveling will help, and Miss Eliza Orme; but
as soon as we can get some of our girls quite ready our assistant
science teachers must come from them.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Ah, ah, how I wish we could get a fine building for the
Camden School; we do want a lecture hall and gymnasium so
much.</p>

<p class='c017'>“If ever we have a little money, I should like the old furniture
in Camden Street to be turned to account in a still lower school—at
a shilling a week. We might work out this plan and have two
schools—not reckoning an evening one—in a room thus used.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Then I want to (perhaps) turn No. 202, Camden Road, into a
Day Training College for Teachers. When we have left the house,
we might give up the large room behind, and so diminish the rent.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Of this Training or Normal College Miss Chessar could be
superintendent, without giving up her whole time. The house
would enable us to train at least a hundred students at a time,
and they must pay for their training; as much, certainly, as the
school fees would amount to.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Our Training College should not receive <i>ignorant</i> girls.
None should join who could not pass our examination at entrance.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Our students should learn the history of great teachers, their
methods, etc., should learn how to teach and what to teach; how
to develop the mental, moral, and physical capacities of their
pupils (by moral I mean also spiritual). We would affiliate to our
College the National Schools, the School Boards of the neighbourhood,
and <i>our own</i> girls’ schools, so that every student in training
should have the opportunity of seeing actual schools in work.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I have not mentioned this last to any one but Mr. Payne,
for several reasons, one being that I am ambitious for the
cause of education and especially for the <i>mixture</i> of sexes; if the
College of Preceptors would take up the idea, it might be better
left to them. Our board might then rent to them our present
house. If the Preceptors <i>won’t</i> do it, then I would urge our board
to try the question.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Our chairman thinks this professional aspect of teaching
ridiculous. I remained silent while he was speaking, as I am
gradually growing into the idea that <i>teaching</i> is one of the noblest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>professions, not second even to medicine—one does with the <i>body</i>,
the other with the immortal <i>soul</i>!</p>

<p class='c017'>“But one point will be to carry first the <i>half-time</i> lower school;
no doubt the Brewers will warm to this, if I can persuade them.
This school might positively be built on <i>their</i> estate, near Camden
Street. The Danish model, I mean!”</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f10'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r10'>10</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Mrs. Fraser died within a year or so of her marriage in 1873, and
Miss Buss writes: “One sad cloud has overshadowed us—the death of my
dear old pupil and recent fellow-worker, Emma Maclean (Mrs. Fraser)....
As I write, my eyes fill with tears at the thought of that fair young
life thus early cut down.... You know how she stood at my side in all
the recent musical changes, but you cannot know what a wonderful teacher
she was. She inspired her pupils, and her power was so great that no
difficulty in managing them ever occurred. I have now to find a successor
to her; replace her I cannot.” A Musical Scholarship was founded in
memory of Mrs. Fraser.</p>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The following letter, written by Miss Buss, appeared
in the autumn of 1872:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c032'>
    <div>“SCHOOL-HOURS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c040'>
    <div>“<i>To the Editor of the ‘Times.’</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—Having had the opportunity recently of becoming
acquainted with the system pursued in the Primary Schools of
Sweden and Denmark, it has occurred to me that we may learn
something from our Scandinavian neighbours with regard to the
very important question: hours of attendance.</p>

<p class='c017'>“One great difficulty we have to face is so to arrange the hours
of school that the children shall be able to attend school and yet
find time for work.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Throughout Denmark education is compulsory, the parents
being liable to fine and imprisonment for neglecting to send their
children to school; but the difficulty of combining school attendance
with freedom for work is met by the simple plan of holding
school twice a day for different sets of children. Five hours being
the required school attendance, one set of children attend from
8 o’clock to 1, with an interval for recreation at 11, and another set
from 1 to 6 o’clock, also with a short interval.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The parents are free to choose between the morning and
afternoon school, according to the work the children have to do.
In the first case, the children can work after 1 o’clock; in the
second, until that hour.</p>

<p class='c017'>“This plan has also another advantage—it enables 2000 children
to be taught in a school-house built and fitted for 1000, and this
without in the least interfering with evening teaching. This is an
important economical question.</p>

<p class='c017'>“One superintendent is sufficient for both schools, as he is not
expected to teach more than 18 hours a week. He has a staff of
assistants, some of whom are visiting teachers only, for special
subjects, such as gymnastics, singing, etc. Elementary teachers
are compelled to teach 36 hours a week, and may, if they wish,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>earn extra payment by extra teaching to the extent of 42 hours.
The time-tables of the schools are so arranged that three sets of
teachers can thoroughly manage four schools.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Would not the adoption of some such plan, modified to suit
local cases, clear away some of our difficulties? A <i>maximum</i>
attendance of four hours daily, from 8.30 to 12.30, and from 1 to 5
o’clock, would, perhaps, be better suited to London, with one day’s
holiday in a fortnight.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The system appears to work well in Denmark, and to produce
the desired results. The children attend school 30 hours a week.
A diminution of the school-hours would still secure 24 hours a
week for each school; but questions of detail must, of course,
depend on local conditions. I merely wish to call attention to the
possible solution of one, at least, of our difficulties.</p>
<p class='c026'>“<span class='sc'>A Practical Teacher.</span>”</p>

<p class='c005'>This last dream never came true. But the advance
in the elementary schools met all need of this kind.
The higher Board Schools form now the connecting-link
with the Camden School.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may be of interest here to show how Miss Buss
carried out her thought about the Camden School, now
housed as nobly as she could have desired. From Miss
Elford, the first head-mistress of the Camden School, as
well as from her successor, there are touching notices
of their relations with the founder of their school—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Miss Buss had long felt the need of such a school, and for
her to feel the need was for her to leave nothing undone until the
need was supplied. It was as far back as the summer of 1868,
when Miss Buss intimated to me—an old pupil—that in all
probability a school would be founded in connection with her
school, the fees of which would be four guineas a year. And
would I like to be its head-mistress! The lowness of the fees
rather alarmed me; but without hesitation, in full confidence of
the success that must attend any scheme she took up, I said yes!</p>

<p class='c017'>“Foresight and forethought were two of Miss Buss’ many and
great qualifications. I have frequently heard old girls say, ‘If
Miss Buss told me to do a thing of which I could not quite see
the advisability, I should do it, knowing that she could see the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>necessity for it, and the good that would result from it, for she
never makes a mistake.’</p>

<p class='c017'>“The Camden School for Girls, however, was not started
until January, 1871, in the old school-houses, Nos. 12 and 14,
Camden Street, which had been until that time occupied by the
North London Collegiate School. It began with the head-mistress
and Miss Buss as superintendent, and was opened with 45 pupils
on the first day, January 16, 1871; 78 entered during the first
term, and the first year closed with 192 pupils.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Miss Buss, deeply interested in its success, watched carefully
its progress, and entered fully into the whole working of the school.
In the early days, the curriculum of work was entirely under her
supervision. She had the power of making others capable of
carrying out her suggestions, and of making them realize their own
ability. The teaching was precisely on the same lines as those
for girls of the same age in the North London Collegiate. The
visits of Miss Buss to the school were frequent, sometimes she
came alone, sometimes with visitors; but Thursday afternoons, for
several years, were specially set apart for work with us. She would
visit every class, and, for the first year or two, knew most of the
girls, encouraging some, stimulating others. All were so glad of
her kind word. Her dress was pulled timidly by a little child to
obtain the desired smile.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Thursday thus became the red-letter day of the week. No
question ever arose but she might be depended on for the wisest
solution of the difficulty.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The need for the school soon spoke for itself, for at the end of
the second year, 1872, there were 331 pupils. And in January,
1873, as many as fifty were unable to be admitted. Girls from all
parts of London, north, south, east, and west, were anxiously waiting
to come in; for at this time there existed no Polytechnic day
schools, nor middle schools for girls. The enthusiasm to enter
was so great that one case may be mentioned of a little girl and
her mother, who hearing that there were so many new ones
applying, got up at six o’clock in the morning to catch the first
train from Acton ‘to be in time.’ Alas! there was no vacancy.</p>

<p class='c017'>“In 1871, seven pupils passed the College of Preceptors’ Examination
in the lowest class. In 1872, seven passed the Junior
Cambridge Local, and 17 the College of Preceptors’. This would
be but little now, but Miss Buss said, let them feel they can do
something, or, as she so often said,  ‘Aim high, and you will strike
high.’</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>“The numbers increased so rapidly, now being 390, that a
third house, No. 18, Camden Street, was taken and adapted, and
no other change was made until May, 1878, when the school
moved to the new buildings in the Prince of Wales Road, Kentish
Town, of which the foundation-stone was laid by Miss Buss.
The numbers had reached 420, with generally 90 or 100 waiting
admission.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The present head-mistress of the Camden School,
Miss Lawford, is also good enough to give some details
of more recent date—</p>

<p class='c014'>“My recollections of Miss Buss begin with my school-days,
and with the very earliest of them. It was to the North London
Collegiate School for ‘Ladies,’ as it was then called, that I was
sent, after a very short experience of school-life elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c017'>“But when the time came to take up work as head of the
Camden School, how greatly was my responsibility lightened by
the sound advice and help which she gave me. I remember one
case of more than usual difficulty which caused me considerable
anxiety, and in which a false step might have given me and the
school an unpleasant notoriety. I took the matter to her, she
seized the point at once, was quite clear as to the action to be
taken, and the whole affair ended happily. The clearness of her
intellect and the facility with which she grasped a situation were
salient traits in her character.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The tie which connects her with the Camden School as its
founder is one which we are proud to remember. She took the
keenest interest in all its work, and in all her visits (she) always
had a word for any girls who had distinguished themselves, or
who were connected in any way with old friends and pupils of her
own. We always looked for her on red-letter days such as Prize
Day and Founder’s Day. On one of these latter she gave us a lecture
on Lady Jane Grey which we specially valued. On these occasions
so many friends wanted her at the North London Collegiate
School that it was not often she could spare more time than to go
round the gymnasium and the schoolrooms, and to speak a few
gratifying words to the girls. She often invited the upper part of
the school to lectures at the North London Collegiate School;
one much enjoyed by them,  ‘A Trip to Sunshine in December,’
gave an account of a Christmas holiday spent in the Riviera.
She remembered us in other substantial ways. The splendid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>photograph of the Colosseum which decorates one of our rooms was
brought by her from Italy. The lending library was partly started
by a sum given by her for the purpose. The building of the
gymnasium and the introduction of trained teachers for physical
exercise was her initiative.</p>

<p class='c017'>“What one feels more especially about Miss Buss is her utter
sincerity. Whether she was helping you in a difficulty or promoting
some great educational movement you felt she did it
without thought of self. There was no touch of the little mind
about her, no thought of adding to her own prestige. She spent
her life in the cause of education with loyalty and single-hearted
devotion. It was the happy lot of some of us to be associated with
her in her work. We have indeed lost a friend whose greatness of
mind and purpose ever stimulated us. We can only be thankful
for the privilege which has been ours, and seek to carry out the
high aims which she set before us.”</p>

<p class='c005'>We know now—a quarter of a century after—what
has been achieved by this great worker whose life
remains as an inspiration for the times to come. What
she aspired to may be best given in her own self-estimate
in those early days.</p>

<p class='c006'>I had sent her an account of a great spiritual work
done by Mary Lyon, a distinguished American teacher,
and received in acknowledgment the following note:—</p>

<div class='c024'>“July, 1871.</div>
<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Miss Ridley</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“I have read Mary Lyon’s ‘Training School.’ In the
past I have often had visions of such, or similar work, but as life
has grown out upon me I have seen these higher hopes and
aspirations fade a good deal. Still, I recognize many blessings
and some usefulness in my life. It has not been a wasted or misused
one. One must do what one can, and leave the issue to Him
who guides all things right.</p>
<p class='c026'>“Yours affectionately,</p>
<p class='c027'>“<span class='sc'>Frances M. Buss</span>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>From this modest self-appraisement I turn now to
the thick volumes—six of them, almost all in her own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>handwriting—notes of the addresses she gave in school
and at Myra, embracing every topic—moral and religious—that
touches a girl’s life.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c018'><sup>[11]</sup></a> How they affected the girls
who heard them letter after letter tells; and we, not so
favoured, may imagine what they must have been, given
in that clear impressive voice, as the results of most
careful thought, and brightened by anecdote and illustration,
gathered in these note-books, from everyday life
and from past history. What is most striking in these
notes is not merely an observation which let nothing
slip, but the wise selection of a varied culture and extensive
reading amounting to high scholarship. And
as we remember that this work was all done amid the
pressure of daily teaching, through all the long struggle
of the establishment of the new schools, and then amidst
the whirl of public life, we scarcely can tell where lies
the greatest wonder—in the work itself, or in the
humility which could include it all in those simple
words: “but one must do what one can!”</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f11'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r11'>11</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A selection from these “Notes” is being prepared for the use of
teachers by Miss Toplis, and will shortly be published by Messrs.
Macmillan and Co.</p>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is easy, after going through these notes, to be sure
of the secret of her great influence. It is teaching that
goes straight to the point because it comes straight
from the heart of the teacher, whose happy pupils had
good reason to say, “What before may have been only
words to us then became facts. She was not so much
a teacher as an inspiration!”</p>

<p class='c006'>How these earlier ideals stood the test of time we
may read in a record given a quarter of a century later
by the colleague who best knew her work of “Education
as known in the North London Collegiate School for
Girls.”</p>

</div>
<p class='c014'>“No one who has been brought into contact with Miss Buss, no one
who has even seen her portrait, can have failed to be struck by her
transparent integrity, her absolute sincerity, her single-mindedness of
purpose. However much one might differ from her on a question of
policy, one felt certain that the judgment was never warped by personal
bias, that it was never prompted by ambition or jealousy, or any vulgar
motive.... As an organizer she was unrivalled.”—<i>Journal of Education</i>,
January, 1895.</p>

<p class='c005'>The summary of Miss Buss’ practical work, for which
I am so deeply indebted to Mrs. Bryant, is best given
in her own words, with merely an interpolation illustrating
that law of order on which these schools are so
firmly based.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Bryant begins with an important reminder—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Teachers are not inapt to forget that the most
important factor in education is the personality of the
learner. The next most important is the personality of
the teacher. So far as others make our education for
us, the mind of the educator is more important by far
than his method. And this is the more true the greater
the teacher.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of Frances Mary Buss this was specially true, so
much was intuition and sympathy in the concrete
inwoven with her thoughts on the educational ideal.
The ideal of her action was an emanation of her nature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>as a whole, not a pure product of thought. She could
have told many things about it, but she could not tell
it all. Her vision was wide, but her wisdom was wider.
Hence there never was any danger that her mind would
harden into a net of secondary principles in the solution
of any individual problem. Practical questions were
always unique, each one in itself, to her; and, rapid as
she was in action, she could give time to deliberation
and careful thought.</p>

<p class='c006'>“To understand, therefore, the ideal of education
under which so much good work has been done, we need
to understand, not a theory true once for all, but the
type of mind that is creative of right ideas as occasion
requires. Nor is a subtle delineation of character
needed here. The leading features are well marked,
and a brief sketch may give the clearest conception.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Breadth and elasticity of imagination, indomitable
energy of will, boundless faith, unwearied sympathy—these
are the great facts of character which lie behind
her work and mark its ideals. They are all very
obvious facts, but the first named, in the nature of the
case, though the rarest and most remarkable, is the
easiest to miss in its full significance. One clear mark
of it is the memory she has left with each of her friends,
of being interested specially in that phase of thought
and work which she shared with them. The effect of
it on her educational work was that extraordinary
catholicity of view which distinguished her, and through
her has influenced in many ways the theory of the girls’
school, and the tone of the educational question in the
days which follow her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“One phase of this catholic way of looking at things
was her insistence, always very emphatic, on the idea
that school and the teacher have to do in some way or
other with the whole of life. She would not allow it to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>be supposed that any condition of the well-being and
good growth of her pupils was no concern of hers. I
do not mean that she at all denied the function of the
home in education. On the contrary, she attached the
greatest weight to it, but she held that whether the home
did its duty or not it was the business of the school to
aim at supplying conditions essential for the development
of the pupil on all sides—to hold itself responsible
for failure even when fathers and mothers had neglected
their part. When parents were wrong-headed, or
negligent, or mistaken, then it seemed natural to her
to set about educating them. Many mothers learned
priceless lessons of wisdom from her in the pleasant
audiences of her “Blue room” at school; and few, I
think, were ungrateful for them. She was full of ready
resource in cases of difficulty, and she ever held that
the moral was much more essentially her business than
the intellectual salvation. When there was trouble with
a girl, she gave herself to its cure with the most absolute
self-devotion, and one great remedy was to send for the
mother, to take counsel with her, and to give her counsel.
In all matters of behaviour, such as foolish talk and
unladylike—or shall I not rather say unwomanly—conduct
she was strict and vigilant. Such things never
escaped her, and her manner of dealing with them
individually has made an epoch in the life of many a
girl, the transition from an irreverent to a reverent state
of feeling for social relationships.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We are of course all familiar with the view that
education is threefold, that it concerns itself with moral,
intellectual, and physical welfare. But there was a
strength and elasticity in Miss Buss’ feeling about
school education as all-embracing that marked it as
more than the consequence of a view. Each girl was a
clearly imagined whole to her, with whose deficiencies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>and needs she had the mother’s no less than the
teacher’s sympathy. She was wonderfully patient, and
sympathetic, too, with foolish mothers, of whom there
are some. She had a kind word and thought for
‘fads,’ strenuously as she resisted them. Forty years—thirty
years—ago, the ‘fads’ that had to be resisted
were many indeed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“So she taught us, her teachers, the duty of infinite
pains, infinite hope in the training of character. She
never gave a girl up as hopeless. If one way failed,
then another must be found. She had great belief—a
belief well justified by facts—in the salvation of
character by way of the rousing of intellectual interests.
It was curious to note how a naughty girl improved if
she grew to like her lessons. Naughtiness is often
unsteadiness of will, and intellectual discipline is a
steadying influence. Irrationality, moreover, is the cause
of much moral evil, and thoughtful study makes for
rationality. It may be—I am much disposed to think
it is—that intellectual training effects greater moral
improvement in women than it does in men, because a
woman’s faults of character, on an average, turn more
on irrationality and lack of nerve control, while the
man’s faults centre in his profounder self-absorption
and slower sympathies.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Character as the prime aim of education soon
became the key-note of the North London practice. It
fell in with this that great attention should be paid to
punctuality, accuracy, order, method, and the cultivation
of the clerkly business abilities generally. Nor should
we forget that simple quality of respect for property,
so despised of boys, on which the head-mistress laid
much stress as essential for girls, and, indeed, a part of
honesty. In very early days, girls spilt ink on their
dresses, so ink ceased to be part of the regular school
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>furniture, and is only given out when required, e.g. for
examinations, by the mistress in charge of the form.
It is part of the tradition of the place—a tradition that
will now be a tender memory—that the giving out of
the ink is a serious responsible act, the weight of which
should never be thrown on a monitor or even a prefect.
The spilling of the ink is an evil so great that its risk
should be laid only on the shoulders of authority. But,
seriously, this is symbolic of the leading idea that the
duty of taking proper care of the furniture should be
taught at school as well as at home.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nobody but a school-mistress—except, indeed, a
schoolmaster—knows to what depths of disorder the
youthful mind may descend in writing out its lessons.
I remember how it astonished me when, even at the
North London Collegiate School, the original sin of
literary untidiness caused itself to be seen. Well, from
the beginning, serious war was made upon irregularities
and disorder of this kind, a whole system of school
routine growing up in consequence, much of which has
become general in girls’ schools.”</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c006'>“Order, Heaven’s first law,” was certainly the first
law of school-life. The place was duly provided, and
everything had to be in its place, an arrangement
greatly helped by the Swedish desks—one for each girl,
of suitable size—which Miss Buss was the first to
introduce into England.</p>

<p class='c006'>Wherever Miss Buss’ influence reached, order reigned.
Everything bore witness to her power of organization,
and everything throughout the place, down to the work
of the lowest servant, was arranged by the head who
said of herself, “I spend my life in picking up pins!”</p>

<p class='c006'>The highest illustration of this quality comes in the
story of Lord Granville’s admiration of the perfect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>arrangements on the Prize Day when he was in the
chair. He could not forget it, and spoke of it to Dr.
Carpenter, in reference to the giving of Degrees at
Burlington House. Dr. Carpenter wrote to Miss Buss
to ask her secret, and in reply she went herself to
Burlington House and discussed with him all the
arrangements, which consequently went off in perfect
order.</p>

<p class='c006'>No girl in either school, who had been long enough
to enter into the spirit of the place, will ever during the
longest life be able to look with indifference on an ink-spot,
or to suppress a feeling of lofty superiority, if she
ever has occasion to pass through a boys’ school, and
cast a glance at desks or floors there. And few will be
able to read without a sympathetic smile or sigh a little
narrative of one of their number showing what came of
inadvertence on this point—</p>

<p class='c014'>“One of the direst days in the whole of my school experience
was the day I spilt the ink.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The accident happened on a Friday, and, since the event,
Black Friday has altered its position on the calendar, as far as I
am concerned.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The terrible meaning the words  ‘spilt ink’ convey to the
mind can only be understood by those who know how dearly Miss
Buss cherished the bright appearance of our beautiful school, and
how she strove to raise a similar feeling in us by occasionally comparing
its appearance with that of other public schools (especially
boys’), and by having every spot and stain forcibly eradicated as
soon as incurred.</p>

<p class='c017'>“This accident happened one Friday morning just before
prayers, and was not confined to a single spot, but included the
contents of a large well-inkstand provokingly full.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Hurrying past the form-table on hearing the hall bell, a long
protruding pen caught in a fold of my dress, the whole apparatus
swung steadily round and fell on the floor with a hideous
splash. There was only time to pick up the stand and pen, the
ink, alas! was foolishly left to soak steadily into the stainless
floor.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>“That morning our bright little service seemed interminably
long, and several notices delayed the filing off of the classes as
speedily as usual.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I was the first to re-enter our room, in which Fraülein stood
alone gazing at the catastrophe.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I told her I was the culprit, and mumbled out something
about ‘telling Miss Buss.’</p>

<p class='c017'>“Her smile and quiet remark,  ‘She vill not vant much telling,’
were hardly reassuring.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Fraülein was quite right; Miss Buss did not want any telling,
the evidence in black and white was quite sufficient. She never
scolded me for the accident, but was vexed at my not having
informed the housekeeper immediately, instead of allowing the ink
to soak comfortably in for twenty minutes.</p>

<p class='c017'>“After a little chat about  ‘Presence of Mind,’ I was told to
repair the mischief, and attempt to get the stain out.</p>

<p class='c017'>“There was no German for me that morning. The time
was occupied in scrubbing the floor with lemons. During the
day several helped, even teachers kindly lending a hand, but
all our efforts were futile, and the ink obstinately refused to
move.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Later on, oxalic acid came into play, Miss Buss personally
superintending the performance, and being really anxious in case
any of the poison should perchance cling to my fingers.</p>

<p class='c017'>“All to no good! On Monday the room was to be used by
the Cambridge examiners, and, as a last resource, the carpenter
and his plane were imperatively summoned.</p>

<p class='c017'>“So ended Black Friday!</p>

<p class='c017'>“I had bought my experience in the ways of inkstands, a
thorough knowledge of eradicating stains, and a life-long lesson
to act more decisively, paying in return a bill, the items of which
ran thus: the cost of lemons, oxalic acid, and the carpenter; lost
marks, a signature in the defaulters’ book, and the most miserable
day of my school experience.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Bryant continues—</p>

<p class='c006'>“In the wholeness of the founders view of her work,
not character and intellect only, but physical welfare
no less belonged to the school aim. Always, in some
form or another, she had this in mind. The most
punctilious care was taken from the first as regards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>sanitary conditions and precautions for wet days.
Shoes had always to be changed, and contrivances for
keeping the rest of the clothing dry—by umbrellas,
cloaks, and common sense—were part of the moral
order of the place. In other words, it was treated as
a breach of the regulations if a pupil came into school
with her dress wet. The result was, and is, that the girls
manage to keep astonishingly dry. Like other sources
of evil, this one has, in the course of years, tended
naturally to decrease, because girls are more sensibly
dressed than they were twenty, ten, or even five years
ago. It is an amusing symptom of the hygienic influence
of the North London School that, in my quest for
properly shaped shoes, I find it best to fall back on the
neighbourhood of Camden Road.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The idea of regular physical education was early
expressed in the institution of calisthenic exercises for
a quarter of an hour after the light lunch in the middle
of the morning. The idea grew and became more
systematic as opportunity made its development possible.
When the new buildings were opened, a splendid
gymnasium had been provided for the purpose. Every
girl was to have a systematic course of physical training
by means of two half-hour lessons in the week from
a regularly trained teacher, besides the ordinary drill
on the other three days. But there might be abnormal
girls who required more or less a special treatment,
and, reflecting on this fact, there arose in Miss Buss’
mind the idea that the physical education ought, as of
course, to be under medical supervision. This implied
that all the pupils should be medically inspected, and
it goes without saying that, to her mind, the medical
inspector should be a woman.</p>

<p class='c006'>“For some years this post has been held by Miss
Julia Cock, M.D., who has carried out a system of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>observation, and record sufficient for the purpose, but
not extending to anything like medical attendance.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The first and essential object was to determine what
kind of physical exercise was required in each case.
The normal girl, and the majority of those even with
defects, would be sent to go through the usual course.
For defects, special treatment by exercise would be
ordered, and this given in the afternoon. Three afternoons
in the week the gymnasium is occupied by these
special gymnastic classes, and the record of physical
improvement made is worthy perhaps of even more
praise than the roll of examination honours won by the
intellectually able. The girls who do best with much
rest and little exercise are also found out and dealt
with accordingly. The physical character of each is
recorded in the medical book, and kept for reference.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Defects of eyesight are also discovered in many
cases, and the parents informed that there is need to
consult an oculist. Other physical weaknesses, as they
thus come to light, can be dealt with similarly if need
be, and the knowledge of them is most valuable in
dealing with the girls in their work. The experiment
of medical inspection, as Miss Buss tried it in her
school, has proved an immense benefit, and the idea
lay very near her heart that all schools—especially all
girls’ schools—should do likewise. It is one of my
regrets that she never knew, she was too ill, that
three memoranda on the subject were given in evidence
to the Royal Commission on Secondary Education, one
of the three being by our medical inspector, Miss Cock,
founded on the experience of the North London
Collegiate School.</p>

<p class='c006'>“As regards intellectual education, it was characteristic
of her that she had not the slightest tendency to
attach more importance to her own than to other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>subjects. This was not simply—it was partly—the consequence
of an all-round logical view; it went with her
elasticity of imagination and extraordinary power of
entering into and sympathizing with things outside
her experience in the ordinary sense. This is the ideal
Prime-Minister quality, and it was hers. She was not
a musician, she did not know mathematics; but I
suppose she has not left the impression more strongly
on any two people of understanding their ideals and
supporting them with enthusiasm and sympathy than
upon Mr. John Farmer, of Balliol College, with reference
to music, and upon myself in mathematics. And in
itself it is a noteworthy fact that she struck from the
very beginning on the idea that science should be an
essential part of the school curriculum, and elaborated
it to so high a pitch that her school was early described
by others as <i>par excellence</i> ‘the science school.’ Her
own scholarship was great in History and in French—genuine
fine scholarship, with the unrivalled power of
graphic description and interesting memory of events
which make history-teaching and is so rare, and with
delightful freshness and power in handling a language
with a class. On this side of her work she was herself
the perfect artist. For the study of science there
had been little opportunity in her girlhood, but just
what had been denied her was just what she most
energetically supplied. I think she would have been
great in science: her mind was scientific in its ways of
work, and she had the practical constructive talent that,
added to thinking power, makes the physicist. The
concrete sciences would have attracted her intellectually
more than the abstract.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But in her ideal of education she came quite
naturally and easily outside her own intellectual tastes
and acquirements. So natural was this to her that she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>has doubtless left the impression on many of the younger
generation that she was mainly a great administrator
rather than also a great teacher with special tastes and
powers of her own.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thus it was the more natural to her to realize instinctively,
as she did consciously, the doctrine of the
harmonious development of all the powers as the aim
of the school education.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Even the casual observer could not fail to have been
struck by the ever-growing, ever-assimilating nature of
her mind. In this respect she never grew older; never
grew as middle-aged as many people are mentally at
twenty-five. Like the Athenians, she was always ready
to hear some new thing. She was ready to give any
reasonable theorist a hearing, though not necessarily to
erect new altars to his ideals. Whenever she heard of
any idea that promised, she would, in later years, speak
of it, and have it discussed at our teachers’ meeting.
Then, if it seemed well, we would hear the propagandist
in a lecture, and afterwards discuss the subject again.
The sequel depended on the opinion formed, but most
new ideas, special and general, came our way. The
Harrow Music School, the Royal Drawing Society, and
Miss Chreimann’s Calisthenics may be mentioned in
particular as having received her recognition very early.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mr. Farmer writes as follows—</p>

<div class='c024'>“Oxford.</div>
<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Mrs. Bryant</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“It is very difficult for me to write that which I feel
about the loss of Miss Buss.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Miss Mary Gurney first introduced me to her.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Soon after that she asked me to examine the music in the
North London Collegiate School. I was afraid at first that she
would not understand my point of view with respect to the study
of music in high schools, But, instead of being misunderstood,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>she gave me her sympathy and help from the first in my
endeavour to make music an earnest and educational part of
school-work.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Miss Buss was not a young head-mistress when I first knew
her; but she was, like my greatest school-friend, Dr. Buller, Miss
Mary Gurney, and the dear old Master of Balliol, fearless in her
belief in all that was for the good of schools, and especially in
the redemption of music from being a time-wasting, emotional
accomplishment.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Miss Buss allowed me to introduce the Harrow Music School
standard text, the purpose of which was to do away with the mere
swagger of certificate-giving, and to make it more a test of the
general work of the school in music. She was always so glad to
find that the majority of girls who did well in music were just those
who were doing well in other school-work.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I shall always remember her patience and kindness in her
presence during the long examinations. She was never shocked
at my hopes, mostly very wildly expressed, for the future of music
in the education of girls.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Music, above all studies, needs backing up with the advantage
of a thoroughly good education. It has always been my endeavour
to keep it from encroaching unfairly on the time and strength of
the girls. Miss Buss understood this, and helped to make it
understood.</p>

<p class='c017'>“You have, my dear Mrs. Bryant, for so long been a witness
to that which I have so clumsily described. Please forgive me.</p>
<p class='c026'>“Yours very truly,</p>
<p class='c027'>“<span class='sc'>John Farmer</span>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“To the same purpose is a letter from Dr. Ablett,
head of the Royal Drawing Society—</p>

<p class='c014'>“So many evidences have come to me of the great part Miss
Buss has played in the development of education, and she gave
such willing and helpful support to the work of this society that
I, personally, unfeignedly mourn her loss.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Our council will be sorry to lose one of its members who, by
her world-wide reputation, added strength to, and won confidence
for, it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Chreimann also bears similar witness—</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>“Miss Buss was amongst the first to introduce into her school
the eclectic (and original) series of physical exercises which have
been termed my  ‘system,’ though my own feeling would always be—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c028'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘For forms and systems let the fools contest:</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Whate’er is best administered is best!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c041'>My aim is to secure equal balance in all the working organs of
the body, with permanence of function and steady gain in beauty
and order, rather than to teach any particular set or sets of
exercises.</p>
<p class='c042'>“Miss Buss had early been impressed by the vastness of waste
consequent on the physical disabilities of girls, and still more by
the need of the grace that goes with well managed strength.
It was for these ends that she urged me to give my time to the
training of teachers, and the subsequent inspection of their work,
rather than to the endeavour after a physical culture, which she
agreed was necessary, but which was years in advance of the sentiment,
alike of the parents and of the majority of educationalists.</p>

<p class='c042'>“Miss Buss probably did more than any other public school-mistress
for the knowledge and adaptation of physical training to
the requirements of girls.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In conclusion, Mrs. Bryant adds—</p>
<p class='c014'>“It was with the same eagerness to learn and get
help and light wherever it could be found that Miss Buss
welcomed the institution of the University Examinations
for schools and scholars. Her gratitude to the
University of Cambridge for having been the first to
come to the help of the girls was very beautiful and
touching. It would have had to be a very good reason
indeed that would make her substitute Oxford for
Cambridge, and the loyalty of her affectionate preference
for Girton over all other colleges was tender
and very deep. She loved Cambridge as if it had been
her own <i>Alma Mater</i>. It was the <i>Alma Mater</i> of so
many of her girls in the early struggling days.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I spoke of energy of will as one of her striking
qualities, and her whole life illustrates this so well that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>it only remains to indicate its influence on the inner
life of the school. She was not always quick to decide
unless it was necessary, and then she decided instantly.
Otherwise she deliberated before decision with great
care, weighing all sides of the matter, as she would say.
But once decided, she acted at once, and kept on acting
till the thing was done. That was where she economized
force, and in it lay the secret of much of her power and
her tradition. Her own mind did not admit of pause
between decision and act, and probably there was no
quality in other people which tried her patience more
than hesitancy after it was certain what ought to be
done. How natural it is to some people is well known,
but by effort and practice the tendency can of course be
mitigated, if not cured. North-Londoners, from association
with her, got into the way of resembling her to
some extent in this respect. It became the habit of the
place—may it long continue—to get under way with
one’s piece of work the instant one knew what it was.
I am very inferior to many of my colleagues in this
respect, and only disguise the fact by economy of
another kind, which perhaps goes naturally with a
more slowly moving will; the economy, namely, of
doing my piece of work so that it has not to be done
again. But for simpler things there is no call for this
economy, and the comfort is great of being surrounded
by persons whose instinct it is to translate the idea into
the action at once.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Her energy was her most obvious quality in school.
Everybody saw that, and each felt that she individually
had to live up to it. Still obvious, but deeper, was her
boundless faith in the possibility of achieving good ends.
The choice of the school motto, ‘We work in hope,’
was characteristic. She pursued her ends without delay;
she pursued them also with the confidence that in some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>way or other they would one day be gained. About her
ends her will would be inflexible; about the means of
accomplishing them her invention was elastic, and her
mind open. And I suppose few persons in this world
ever carried out their ends with so much or such well-deserved
success. Her secret was to be uncompromising
about essentials only.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Her faith in the latent possibilities of character,
even when most unpromising, amounted to a principle
of educational action, which she wielded with marvellous
effect, because its hold was even more strong on her
heart than on her head. She seemed almost to believe—but
this is an exaggeration—that any one could be made
to do or become anything. She produced wonderful
results in the way of training up efficient workers
when others would have despaired; though sometimes
she did it at immense cost to herself. She believed in
every one, but she would let bad work pass with no
one. She was at once the strictest of critics and the
least despondent. Thus she made what she would of
many, especially of those who had very much to do
with her in the earlier years. Not that she was ignorant
of their limitations either, but limitations did not trouble
her. She had absolutely none of that restless critical
spirit which requires that everybody should be made to
order, all over again, and different. She took them as
they were, loved them, and made the best of them in
both senses.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Every girl was good for something to her eye and
in her heart. It was her business—our business—to
find out how the most could be made of her, and to
make it. And just in proportion as good in people was
the reality she saw, so was their evil, for the most part,
a transitory unreality. Young people at least are apt
to be and do what you expect of them. She dwelt on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>the good, insisted on it to them, wrestled for it with
them, established it in them, and straightway forgot the
evil or remembered it only as a passing phase. And
the sign of this large-hearted sympathy in an optimistic
temperament is shown in the special devotion to Miss
Buss of all the so-called naughty girls.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It is needless to enlarge on her possession of the
administrator’s gift of relying with generous trust upon
her tried helpers. This, too, was in her a matter of the
heart quite as much as of the head. She felt about
them as one with her in a joint work of which in all
its phases she spoke as ‘ours,’ not as ‘mine.’ It was
pleasanter, more natural to her, to be the controlling
centre of a plural will than to be a single will governing
others with more or less allowance for their freedom.
As regards the question of the relation of the head to
her assistants, this might be described as the theory of
her practice, elastic as all theories must be in a mind
of truly practical genius. She believed thoroughly in
the legal autocracy of the head as the best form of
school government, but in her view of the autocrat’s
standard for himself she expected him to exercise rule
with due regard for ministers and parliaments.”</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Probably none of her public work gave Miss Buss
more unqualified satisfaction than the Head-mistresses’
Association, of which the first germ seems to be contained
in a passage from one of her Journal-letters
of September, 1874, written from Bonaly Tower,
Edinburgh—</p>
<p class='c014'>“Miss Beale of Cheltenham called on me the day I was in
London.... She and I think we must form an Association of
Head-mistresses, and hold conferences occasionally, in order to
know what we ought to assert and what surrender.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Dr. Hodgson showed me, in the  ‘Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table,’
a passage about the ‘<i>membre à question</i>,’ and the ‘<i>membre
à by-laws</i>;’ the latter is called ‘<i>un Empereur manqué</i>,’ and is the
member who awes the rest of a committee by his rigid adherence
to by-laws.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Just think of <i>men</i> discussing for hours the arrangements of
girls’ boarding-houses—how the beds should stand, etc.!”</p>

<p class='c005'>All who have been behind the scenes in the development
of public schools for girls can read in
between the lines here the various stages by which the
Association of Head-mistresses came into being.</p>

<p class='c006'>The question of the management of these new
schools was naturally one of supreme interest to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>women who had made such schools possible. When
Miss Davies was asked by Lord Taunton, during her
examination by the Commission, to mention any point
of importance in connection with the education of
women, she fixed on the point of the presence of women
on the councils of girls’ schools, on equal terms with
men, and not on any separate ladies’ committee. She
was warmly supported by Miss Beale and Miss Buss in
this view that, for the management of girls, women were
essential. Miss Buss, in a letter written some time afterwards,
but before the change in her own schools, sums
up the whole question concisely—</p>

<p class='c014'>“If your plans lead you to prefer a committee to a board of
trustees, I advise you not to allow two committees—one of gentlemen
for money matters, and one of ladies for internal arrangements.
Two committees always clash, sooner or later. The
mistress disagrees with the ladies’ committee, the gentlemen
interfere, and the usual result is that the ladies resign in a body.
I do not think any better plan can be devised than a single council
of men and women, with certain well-defined duties to perform,
but with no power of continual and daily interference with the
mistress. In this opinion I am unbiassed by personal feeling,
because, as this school is my own property, I have never had to
work with a committee. But I hear on all sides of the difficulties
which arise, and which are, apparently, to be prevented only by the
plan I have suggested.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Grey, when examined on March 25, 1873,
before the “Endowed Schools Committee,” gave her
opinion in favour of women on the governing body of
every school, on the ground that a ladies’ committee
“was powerful only to object and interfere, but powerless
to carry into effect any of their suggestions, however
valuable these might be.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It is evident that what is wanted is a consultative
body—a sort of Privy Council—to advise and help in
matters external, and in cases of special difficulty;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>whilst, in the internal affairs of the school, the head
must be held responsible. It would follow that, to
make a council really useful, there must be some principle
of selection to secure the right persons, so that it
should not be said in the future, as has been so often
possible to say in the past, that “head-masters and
mistresses are chosen with care, their degrees, experience,
etc., all sifted, and then they are set to work under a
governing body chosen haphazard, or anyhow!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Most of the great schools owed their prosperity to
the skill and character of some one man or woman,
and, even after they had attained success, were still
dependent on their head, who, instead of being allowed
free play, was checked and thwarted by this haphazard
council—the “expert” being under the control of the
mere “amateur.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In such cases, the “managing committee” is clearly
not what is wanted. Here are weighty words from a
head-mistress, who must take highest rank among the
“experts”—</p>

<p class='c014'>“No one knows how much of one’s health and energy is lost
to the school by the anxieties of getting those who do not understand
the complicated machinery not to interfere with things with
which the head alone ought to deal.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Governors have no idea of the worries head-mistresses have,
when hysterical girls invent absurd stories; when parents and
doctors attribute every illness, real or imaginary, to lessons; when
teachers get wrong, or when they suddenly disappear, take head-mistress-ships
elsewhere, and draw away their friends and pupils.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Then, again, the governing body will blame for the inevitable,
or a head will deal with ninety-nine intricate cases, and in the
hundredth will make a mistake; they naturally know nothing of
the former, but of the latter they hear, only to condemn.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This is one very important side. The head clearly
has very definite rights. But, there is also the other
side, and the members of the council have also their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>rights. Even the “mere amateur” is not without
rights, as a person who, in combining special interest
in education, with wider and more varied experience
than can be enjoyed by the professional educator, is
therefore of use on the council in his power of seeing
things from the outside, and thus bringing to bear on
them a judgment not warped by mere professional bias.
Even on the most haphazard council, the persons elected
are at least supposed to have some power of help.
These “amateurs” are consequently persons who are
more used to lead than to follow, to take the active rather
than the passive attitude, and to whom mere acquiescence
is as uncongenial as it is unaccustomed. It is therefore
easy to imagine such a council growing restive, even
under the most competent leading, and asking, “Is it
really our whole duty to sit here simply to register the
decrees of the head-mistress?”</p>

<p class='c006'>To strike the happy mean between tyranny and
subjection is the duty alike of the governing body and
of head-master or mistress. The governing body must
not rule; nor, on the other hand, must its members be
too passive, or acquiesce when they ought to oppose.
If they are bound to follow competent leading, they are
no less bound to dismiss the incompetent. The captain
of a ship gives place to a duly accredited pilot, but he
is none the less bound to judge whether the ship is
making for the straight course or not. To give up his
command into unskilful hands is, on the one side, as
foolish as it would be to tie the pilot to the mast, and
let the ship go down, whilst the crew dispute for the
right to steer.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is evident that, with the best intentions on both
sides, great tact and forbearance are needed to prevent
occasional friction. And we need not wonder
that, as a matter of fact, there was on most governing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>bodies in those early days a considerable amount of
friction.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of this Miss Buss had, in her own experience, comparatively
little; but what she had, arose entirely from
this very point. She had arranged, when she gave up
her private school, that it should be in the hands of a
body of trustees, who would hold it for the public good,
but who were not intended to interfere with her own
development of the work which she had herself begun
and carried on to success.</p>

<p class='c006'>As the founder of the school, and as a life-member
of a board on which the other members were elected
for short periods, her position was unique. To this,
also, must be added the fact that, for the first two years,
the new schools were carried on by means of her own
liberal donations and those of her personal friends. It
was not to be expected that she could hold the same
relation to her governing body as the ordinary head-mistress,
who is appointed by them, and over whom
they have the right of dismissal.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was perhaps a little unfortunate that at the time
of special difficulty, the chairmanship seemed to have
become permanent in the appointment of a chairman,
who, however fitted for the post, was yet only imperfectly
acquainted with the early history of the school, and,
therefore, not unnaturally gave undue weight to the
help given by the Board, regarding the new scheme
rather as an entirely fresh departure, than as what it
actually was, merely the expansion of an existing
organization, and still dependent on the skill to which
it owed its rise. He had been accustomed to long-established
foundations, where everything went by rule,
and to committees where the word of the chairman
was law. Miss Buss was used to supreme power over
her own school, and she was, like most women of that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>day, unused to business routine. This was, moreover,
one of the very first governing bodies on which women
were elected on equal terms with men. Such an
arrangement was too new as yet to go without hitch.
It would follow, quite naturally, that men, out of mere
force of habit, as well as in real kindness of heart,
should adopt a paternal and authoritative attitude
towards all women, even to those most competent to
stand alone.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Buss was by nature one of the least self-assertive
of women. She had always been helped by
some strong man, and had accepted all help with
gratitude. First Mr. Laing, and then Dr. Hodgson
(with her father and brothers, as a matter of course),
had been recognized as friends and helpers.</p>

<p class='c006'>But, at the same time, one of the most definite aims
of her life had been to raise the status of the head-mistress
to the same level as that of the head-master.
For the sake of all teachers—not for her own sake—she
deprecated the secondary place given to women
who were doing the same work as men. She also
thought the internal management of her school should
be left to her, as it would have been to a head-master in
her place, and for this she stood firm, even when, as a
matter of mere feeling, she might have given way, for
she was really one of the old-fashioned women who
would personally endure anything for the sake of
peace.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is more than probable that she felt some things
too strongly, and that she misunderstood others. In
those days, most women suffered quite needlessly from
sheer ignorance of business routine. They lacked the
training and discipline which carry men unscathed
through the roughness of public life. Two men meeting
on a committee may oppose each other tooth and nail,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>but these men may afterwards go home and dine comfortably
together, bearing no traces of the fray. At
that date, two women, after a similar encounter, would
have gone their separate ways, to weep over a solitary
cup of tea, and when next they met would pass each
other with the cut direct.</p>

<p class='c006'>To a woman like Miss Buss, nothing of this sort
would have been possible, for even if she had not had
too much common sense, she had that most uncommon
power of forgiveness which led to the saying, “If you
really want to know <i>how</i> kind Miss Buss is you must
do her some injury!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Nevertheless, however evanescent her feeling might
be, she did for the time feel her worries very intensely.
It chanced that, as my way lay beyond Myra Lodge,
I usually drove her home from the meetings, and she
then relieved her pent-up feelings by rapid discussion
of any vexed question from her own point of view.
By the time our drive ended, she was, as a rule, quite
ready for her ordinary meal, and we parted more often
than not with a jest, for this process was merely a
question of “blowing off the steam,” and I served as
safety-valve. It was entirely a matter of temperament.
Whilst some temperaments fail to perceive the existence
of a grievance until it is formulated in words,
others can throw off in words all the bitterness of even
the worst grievances. Miss Buss belonged to the latter
class, and, as I understood this thoroughly, I could
forget her words as soon as spoken. Where such hasty
utterances were taken seriously by persons of the
opposite temperament, she was at times seriously misunderstood.</p>

<p class='c006'>During the nine years of suspense between the
changes of 1870 and the opening of the new buildings
in 1879 there was much to try the most perfect patience.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>Here is a little note showing the kind of thing that used
at first to cause a protest—</p>

<p class='c014'>“<span class='sc'>My very dear little Annie</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“I feel a little ashamed of my impatience to-day, but
am happy to find that Miss Elford was in the same frame of mind.
Lady X. talked quite wildly about this and that, and what ought
or ought not to be. These ladies have not an idea beyond the
parish school, where the lady of the manor is supreme, and dictates
to the children what they shall wear, and what they shall not, how
to do their hair, etc., etc. If it were not so pitiable in its ignorance
I could find it in my heart to cry, or to run away and leave the
board to manage its schools.</p>

<p class='c017'>“How very thankful I am that you have always a soothing
effect on me. My dear love to you,</p>
<div class='c039'>“<span class='sc'>Arnie</span>.”</div>

<p class='c005'>This was probably one of many instances in which
Miss Buss suffered from an imperfect knowledge on
the part of the public. Endowments for girls’ schools
were still so novel that the demand for money for the
Camden School was, in some absurd way, associated
with the Founder, as if she were herself a recipient,
instead of being, as she was, one of the most generous
of donors, giving herself and her means for the public
good.</p>

<p class='c006'>For example of the sort of trial involved in working
with a committee to one so used as Miss Buss had been
to direct, rapid and free action, we may take an experience
in 1872, when the governing body, intent only on
saving her trouble in the temporary absence of the
Rev. A. J. Buss (Clerk to the Board), appointed a special
Prize Day Committee. It had been decided that, to
bring the work more clearly before the public, the
Princess Louise should be asked to give the prizes in
the Albert Hall. We give Miss Buss’ report from her
Journal-letters—</p>

<div class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>“June 22.</div>

<p class='c017'>“I went yesterday to the Albert Hall and heard that it was
let for the 19th.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The secretary was very polite, however, and, finding he had
to do with a princess, got the date altered to suit us. The fees
will cost £30. The secretary says we ought to distribute bills
through the exhibition, besides advertising, and let people in who
choose to <i>pay</i> for entrance. This will require consideration on
Monday.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Mr. Roby will speak, and I mean to ask him to say what
Miss Davies has done for education. On Saturday there is a
conference of teachers in the rooms of the Society of Arts. We
shall see plenty of people there, and can ask some one to speak.
Dr. Lyon Playfair is to take the chair.</p>

<p class='c017'>“For the day itself we must invite <i>thousands</i>. Every member
of Parliament, every member of a city company, every clergyman
and Nonconformist of note. Invite all the press, all known
educationalists, etc., etc.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Let us hope we shall have our own hall by next year, and
then we shall not need to go away from home.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“July 2.</div>

<p class='c017'>“Mr. Forster can’t take the chair. Lord Derby declines, and
now, at 2 p.m., comes a note to say the Princess Louise <i>will not be
able to attend</i>!</p>

<p class='c017'>“Dr. Storrar goes to-morrow morning to see Mr. Holzmann,
and consult with him. We hope to get access to Princess Mary.</p>

<p class='c017'>“If not where are we? Curiously enough, this sort of thing
does not worry me—at least, not much.... Nothing but the
necessity of working with other people would have made me allow
the matter to be so delayed. <i>June</i> is our month, and always has
been. However, I am quite cool about matters. The inevitable
must be endured.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“Myra Lodge, July 11, 8 a.m.</div>

<p class='c017'>“The chairman sends Col. Airey’s note to say Princess Mary
declines. I shall go at once to consult Mr. Elliott.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“202, Camden Road, July 11, 11 a.m.</div>

<p class='c017'>“Mr. Elliott is going to try the Duke of Edinburgh. I am
to get rid of the Albert Hall, however, <i>coûte que coûte</i>.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Everything is at a standstill. Never in my working life has
there been such a complete <i>fiasco</i>.”</p>

<div class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>“July 13.</div>

<p class='c017'>“I must write later to answer your notes fully, but, at 8 o’clock
this morning, I went to our vicar, Mr. Cutts, for a note to the
bishop’s chaplain, whom I do not know. I then went to Mr.
Elliott; returned to breakfast, and then dashed out with the fixed
determination not to return until the Prize Day arrangements had
been made.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I drove in the storm to St. James’ Square (London House),
Bishop not there, but at Fulham; drove to Fulham, sent in my
note to the chaplain, who saw me <i>at once</i>, and asked me to go to
the bishop. I said I wanted to ask a question, and would not
disturb him if possible. So Mr. Gamier took in my message,
‘Would the bishop preside for even half an hour at our meeting—on
<i>any hour</i> and <i>any day</i> in the next fortnight.’</p>

<p class='c017'>“The bishop positively had not one hour available. He went
through his list, but he would give me <i>Monday</i>, the <i>29th</i>, at 3 o’clock.
Of course I accepted, rushed away to St. James’ Hall—not to be
had anyhow for two months—thence to Willis’ Rooms, which we
can have.</p>

<p class='c017'>“How much I regret allowing a committee to be formed! If
Mr. Elliott, Mr. Danson, and I had been empowered to act, we
should have had one of the Princesses. There would have been
no delay by notes going first to the chairman and then having to
be sent to me. If I had had the note of Princess Louise’s secretary
at 8 a.m., by 10 I should have been at her house, and should
<i>certainly</i> have got an introduction to Princess Mary. In this case,
the memorial to the latter would have been in her hands by
Saturday morning, instead of Tuesday! and would have been
accompanied by a note from either Princess Louise or Lord Lorne.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Don’t think me very egotistical, but don’t expect me to summon
a committee for the Prize Day again.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I shall quietly go my own way now, and <i>do</i> the things. That
last committee took up two hours and twenty-five minutes of my
time in the middle of the day, and for what? (I told you two hours,
but made a mistake.)</p>

<p class='c017'>“I forgot to say I went to the printer, ordered all the invitations,
and expect them on Monday. But Willis’ Rooms, though
handsome, are <i>not large</i>. With every card we will send out the
slip about Princess Louise’s failure in her engagement.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The meeting went off as well as these meetings
always did. But next year the Princess Mary of Teck
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>was secured without difficulty; as well as afterwards
several other members of the Royal Family, including
even the Prince and Princess of Wales.</p>

<p class='c006'>It must have been at this period that an equally
characteristic little story is told. Miss Buss, in the
height of her vexation, sought comfort beside her sister
and her boy. As she entered the room, she exclaimed,
“<i>This</i> is what I have brought on myself, and <i>for what</i>?”
with an impatient stamp of her foot. Baby Frank lifted
his great eyes solemnly to his aunt, and, with a deliberate
stamp of his baby foot, echoed, “And for vot?” on
which, as she clasped him in her arms, all her indignation
vanished in a shower of kisses.</p>

<p class='c006'>But that she did not demand mere acquiescence
from her friends is proved by many of her letters, one
of which may be given, not only as showing her many-sidedness,
but also as revealing the true humility which
was the secret of her strength.</p>

<p class='c006'>She had been long overstrained by anxiety and suspense,
and had to some extent lost patience under the
many demands on her. At one time, indeed, she even
entertained serious thoughts of resigning her post unless
things could be made easier for her by the assurance of
greater freedom of action. On the occasion of this
particular letter, the usual talk had failed, and I must
have written that same evening still more strongly,
urging either a more complete submission to the inevitable,
or else some bold stroke for liberty. She
thus responds—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Late as it is, and in spite of a distressing headache, I must
just write a few words to say how much I love and thank you for
your note. The advice in it I will try to follow.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yet, dearest Annie, it tears me in pieces to have to be always
asserting myself. But it seems to me to be impossible to go on
without a certain amount of freedom of action.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>“Dearest Annie, I sobbed myself to sleep like a child, such a
thing not having occurred for years. The Mystery of Pain!—if it
were a clear duly to bear it, I would go through anything, but I
cannot see the duty, and can feel the pain....</p>

<p class='c017'>“You must take me as I am, dear Annie, with all my failings.
If I am too impetuous, too energetic, too rash, these are all part of
such virtues as I may possess, and, without the two first, the work
that I have done would never have been done; and the last I do
not think I am. Other feelings, of course, I have, unconscious and
unknown to me. But take me as I am.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I had a long and grave talk to Miss ——, who counsels fight,
but not on any personal ground. She says, ‘Resign, if there is
interference with the mistress’ liberty of action. That is a public
question, and one of public interest.’</p>

<p class='c017'>“She was so good and loving; she was so tender; and she is
so wise and calm.</p>

<p class='c017'>“She told me some of her own worries, and said that sometimes
she quivered in every nerve at her own council meetings.
People came in and asked for information, involving hours of work
for no result; ignored all that had been done, and talked as if
they alone had done everything and knew everything. She urged
me to try and be <i>im</i>personal, so to speak; to remember that these
and similar difficulties would always occur where there are several
people. She said that <i>women</i> were always accused of being <i>too
personal</i>, and harm was done by giving a handle to such an
assertion.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Dearest Annie! I must try to follow your advice, and think of
the work and not of myself. Please help me! Be a true friend,
and don’t fear saying even unpleasant things to me if you think
them deserved. I shall not quarrel.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Worried and annoyed as I have been, I have never in my
whole life been cut by, or had a quarrel with, even the most absurd
parent! But you know I am to give in my resignation, if a public
question, such as payment of teachers, hours of work etc., is
raised.”</p>

<p class='c005'>There were few head-mistresses who in those early
days escaped some such trouble. Referring to one very
well-known instance, in 1874, Miss Buss remarks—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I see they are still in a state of fight at Milton Mount; there
seems to have been a great storm at the annual meeting. I am so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>sorry for Miss Hadland, who is one of the best and bravest women
I know. I feel that she has fought for a principle, and not in mere
self-assertion. It is hard discipline to be thwarted at every turn
when she has only a single eye for the children’s best education
for this life and the next. Any worries that I have had in the past
sink into insignificance compared with Miss Hadland’s.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The recurrence of such difficulties rendered it desirable
that the head-mistresses should take counsel
together, and try to secure some firm and settled line of
action which might lead to the avoidance of misunderstandings
between themselves and their governing bodies.</p>

<p class='c006'>There was already in existence a very useful
“School-Mistresses’ Association,” of which the head-mistresses
were all members. But, as including assistant-mistresses,
private governesses, and even the “mere
amateur,” these meetings were better adapted for the
discussion of general educational questions than for the
special difficulties of one branch of the profession.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Buss had been one of the most active members
of the School-Mistresses’ Association, which had its origin
in a suggestion made by Miss Davies, to which reference
is made in a letter, dated December, 1865, from Miss
Buss to Miss Davies—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I think your proposal about the meetings admirable. The
first meeting with men, Mr. Fitch, or some one, in the chair; the
rest modelled on the Kensington Society.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c018'><sup>[12]</sup></a> But where you will get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>your papers from, is the question! There is so little leisure in a
teacher’s life.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I think it would be useful and pleasant to meet the Assistant-Commissioners,
and hear some of their experience. Such a meeting
might be annual, and the others quarterly. I mean a mixed
meeting of men and women for the annual, because, after the
Commission ceases to sit, I suppose the Assistant-Commissioners
will disappear.”</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f12'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r12'>12</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The “Kensington Society,” to which reference is here made, is thus
described by Miss Davies—</p>

<p class='c020'>“The Kensington Society was not exactly an educational union, though
it arose out of the agitation for the local examinations. I had, in working
for that, made acquaintance, partly by correspondence, with a good many
people of kindred interests. It seemed a pity that we should lose sight of
each other when that particular bit of work was accomplished; so a little
society was formed to meet and read papers from time to time. Mrs.
Manning, the step-mother of Miss Adelaide Manning, was president, and
as the meetings were often held at her house in Kensington, we took that
name. Miss Buss was a member, but did not take an active part. This
society lived, I think, for about three years.”</p>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The School-Mistresses’ Association was finally started
in April, 1867, with Miss Davies as honorary secretary.
Miss Buss became president in the second year.</p>

<p class='c006'>In an early report, reference is made to a suggestion
from Miss Clough, which led to the first action having
for its object co-operation among teachers. It was
ascertained that—</p>

<p class='c014'>“While practically school-mistresses were singularly isolated,
some teachers having scarcely so much as a speaking acquaintance
with any professional associate, such isolation was involuntary,
and felt to be a great drawback to usefulness. It was agreed to
meet together, at stated times, for the discussion of subjects
specially interesting to teachers.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A Library Committee, with Miss Gertrude King as
secretary, undertook the formation of a Teachers’
Library, and of a Registry for Professors. With the
exception of the attempt of the Governesses’ Benevolent
Institution, this seems to have been the first effort made
by any educational body towards duly qualified and
certified teaching.</p>

<p class='c006'>The meeting mentioned in Miss Buss’ letter was
held, early in 1866, at the house of Miss Garrett (Mrs.
Garrett-Anderson), and was attended by several of the
Assistant-Commissioners, and by other persons interested
in the new movements. Matters relating to
the Schools Inquiry—still in progress—were discussed,
as well as the question of education in general.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>A valuable series of papers on general educational
points, by able writers, was issued by the association,
and various technical questions were fully discussed; but
the larger movements, such as the Local Examinations,
and the proposed Woman’s College at Hitchin, occupy
a very prominent place in the report which dwells on
what is the true basis of any useful association—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Apart from any tangible results, it has been felt that the
recognition of a common bond—the kindling of zeal and courage,
by the contact of congenial minds—the cheering consciousness of
sympathy in working together for a great end, amply justify the
existence of such an association.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The School-Mistresses’ Association continued its work
until the increase of the new Endowed Schools made a
division of its members into three distinct classes, head-mistresses,
assistant-mistresses, and private governesses.
The two first formed themselves into distinct associations,
while the third was absorbed by the Teachers’
Guild, which also drew in the amateurs.</p>

<p class='c006'>Having fostered and protected this threefold fruitage
up to the period of ripening, the parent association then
fell apart, its work being done.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Teachers’ Guild was originated by Miss Buss,
at a meeting held on February 7, 1883, at the North
London Collegiate School for Girls. On May 16 it
was formally inaugurated at a meeting of the School-Mistresses’
Association, and it was then taken up warmly
by the Head-mistresses’ Association.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of the rise of the Assistant-mistresses’ Association,
Miss E. P. Hughes writes, referring to the help given
by Miss Buss—</p>

<p class='c014'>“In 1884, at a little meeting in my room at Newnham, it was
decided to start the Assistant-mistresses’ Association, the initiative
being left to Mrs. Corrie Grant, Miss Eves, and myself. I wrote
to Miss Buss and to several other leaders in education. Miss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>Buss’ answer was the first we received, and I distinctly remember
the impression it produced. She sympathized keenly with the
desire for union, seeing at once the possible danger of antagonism
to other associations, but also seeing the way to avoid this danger.
Without her sympathy and advice I do not think the association
would have been started just then.”<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c018'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f13'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r13'>13</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That Miss Buss’ interest did not relax is shown by the resolution
passed by the Assistant-mistresses’ Association after the news of her
death: “A great loss has fallen on the profession, a loss we should call
irreparable did we not know that no devoted service dies, but lives and
bears fruit in many wonderful and unexpected ways. A great worker has
been called to her rest, and we who remain seem little as compared with
her who is gone. As teachers we must all feel how much we have lost,
while to some the loss is dearer and more personal.”</p>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Miss Buss and Miss Beale may claim to have started
the Head-mistresses’ Association, with the help of Miss
H. M. Jones and a few others, who met at Myra Lodge
in the Christmas vacation of 1873, to formulate its
constitution.</p>

<p class='c006'>In her memorial notice,<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c018'><sup>[14]</sup></a> Miss Toplis tells us that the
name of this new association was due to Miss Buss, as
she says—</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f14'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r14'>14</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>Educational Review</i>, January, 1895.</p>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“How many of those who now hold the honourable position
and title of head-mistress know that they owe this title to her?
She had succeeded in convincing the authorities that in the new
schools which were to come into existence a woman could be the
actual head, and that there was no need to put her and her school
under a man as director (which was the only idea that occurred to
them); and then arose this question, what should the lady be
called?—superintendent, lady-principal, director? ‘A thought
flashed into my mind,’ she used to say, ‘if head-master, why not
head-mistress, as the exact equivalent?’ And, much to my
surprise, the suggestion was immediately accepted.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Buss became president of the association, retaining
the office till the end, when her place was taken
by Miss Beale; the duties during the long illness being
undertaken by Miss H. M. Jones, as deputy-president.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>Miss H. M. Jones, in a letter on Christmas Day,
1894, speaks for the whole body in her expression of
sorrow—</p>

<p class='c014'>“How many will feel to-day that they have lost a friend on
whose judgment and advice they could always rely! Few women
have exercised so great an influence on the educational movements
of the present day, and still fewer have worked so hard as she has
done to secure the greatest possible advantages to the girls of this
and future generations. She will be greatly missed and greatly
mourned.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It is just twenty-one years ago that a few of us head-mistresses
met during the Christmas holidays to establish the
Association, of which she has since then been the honoured
president, and in which she always took so great an interest. In
fact, as you know, Miss Buss has been foremost as a leader in all
our deliberations and in all our efforts.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Elsie Day, of the Grey Coat Hospital, Westminster,
adds a very interesting fact in the history of
the Association; as, after the expression of personal
grief, she says—</p>

<p class='c014'>“She was emphatically the mother of the head-mistresses. We
looked to no one, as we did to her, for wise and loving help. For
myself, I can only say I have loved her for twenty years.</p>

<p class='c017'>“What I am anxious for is, that in any notice of her, when it
would be suitable, it should be mentioned that it was at her
request that, when the Head-mistresses’ Association met here, in
1885, there was a special celebration for the Association. She
wrote in the sweetest and most modest way, asking me if I saw my
way to it, and Canon Furse celebrated at my request. Such an
early celebration has been held and much appreciated almost every
year since.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It is because I believe that I have had the credit of initiating
this that I am desirous that it should be known that, although I
made the arrangements, the thought was hers. We want to help
the younger heads to realize her beautiful unwitting saintliness.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Another friend among the head-mistresses, whom
she often visited, tells how at night Miss Buss liked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>that they should kneel down, and together say the
<i>Veni Creator</i>.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c018'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f15'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r15'>15</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This simplicity and devoutness are well shown in a letter to my
father, in reply to a poem which he had sent her. He was for many years
an invalid, and Miss Buss kept him in constant remembrance in sending
flowers or books. She knew that she was never forgotten in his prayers—</p>

<p class='c020'>“Myra Lodge, December 4, 1883.</p>

<p class='c020'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Mr. Ridley</span>,</p>
<p class='c043'>“It is very good of you to write to me, and I shall take great
care of your letter. Miss Hickey’s poem is very beautiful and suggestive.
In my intensely active life I do feel, at times especially, the need of
spiritual uplifting. Early last week, before your letter came, I had felt
this from joining a communion service in the house of a dear friend,
whose only child, a grown-up son, was dangerously ill.</p>

<p class='c020'>“I know very little of thought-transference, but I wonder whether in
some wonderful and mysterious way this craving was made known to you.</p>

<p class='c046'>“Yours most truly,</p>
<p class='c047'>“<span class='sc'>Frances M. Buss</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Those who knew her best know best the force of
the description given of her by her friend Miss Beale in
her deeply appreciative sketch<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c018'><sup>[16]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f16'>

<p class='c014'>“<i>How</i> full of prayer was her life only a few intimate friends
know; one felt that for her the words were true, ‘They that wait
on the Lord shall renew their strength;’ and one is glad to think
that these words are in a higher sense true for her now—</p>

<p class='c041'>and that those who have entered into rest, yet rest not, but in
their glorified life give utterance to that fuller vision of holiness
which was once hidden by the clouds of earth.”</p>
<p class='c005'>The prayerful attitude of spirit characteristic of all
who live “as seeing things invisible” must tend to the
graces of simplicity and humility. Nothing was more
touching than to note these special graces in one so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>strong and so capable, so eager and impetuous, and
dowered with a will that swept everything before it.
Her own personal wants were of the simplest, and no
one ever gave less trouble to those around her. From
Mr. Latham, who, as secretary to the Endowed Schools’
Commission, saw most of her in her public life, comes
a very striking testimony to this point in her character
when, after acknowledging with full appreciation how
she “has done the state good service,” he adds—</p>

<p class='c014'>“The simplicity of her life and the tranquillity of her demeanour
always seemed to me to mark her out in rather a special way
among her comrades in the cause of the education of women
and girls, of which she was a most distinguished pioneer.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Amid the apparently endless multiplicity of her
objects in life ran the one simple purpose of faithful
service, and thus in all complexity there was still a
complete order. Confusion is the result only of the
clash of selfish aims with social duties. To the “heart
at leisure from itself” life must always remain simple
and harmonious.</p>

<p class='c006'>To this humility Miss Beale also bears witness,
touching first on a point of special interest in connection
with their professional work—</p>

<p class='c014'>“The next thing that struck us was her <i>generosity</i>, not only in
money—though that was very great—but in personal service, in
thoughtfulness of others. If there was any improvement she could
suggest in organization, in methods of teaching, she made it her
business, at no little expense of money and time, to distribute the
information to others; never considering them as rivals, but as
fellow-workers, in a common cause.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Next to her charity, one was impressed by her <i>humility</i>. ‘Let
each esteem other better than themselves,’ was the rule of her own
life, while she always seemed to look for excellences, rather than
failings, and to seek to develop, in all, the right emulation, ‘If
there be any virtue, any praise, think of these things.’”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>One of our greatest teachers tells us that “the test
of a truly great man is his humility,” and certainly to
the small, self-centred soul no grace is more difficult of
attainment.</p>

<p class='c006'>This humility was very striking in its contrast with
the strength and power of this strong woman. In things
large or small it was the same; she was the first to admit,
either to teachers or pupils, any error of judgment, or any
small seeming inconsiderateness, so easy in her terribly
overcrowded life. Of this, one of the staff says aptly—</p>

<p class='c014'>“She had also the power, so often wanting in a strong leader,
of acknowledging a mistake. I shall never forget the impression
made on me on receiving a note from her, apologizing for what I
might perhaps characterize as a failure in courtesy. That was
several years ago, but even then she was able to plead the pressure
on her nerves of the work whose magnitude none of us can ever
know.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And one of the party of a Roman holiday relates,
with moist eyes, how, one day when she had retired to
her room, up a long flight of stairs, she heard a knock
at the door, and there found Miss Buss, who had followed
her all the way up just to say, “I am afraid,
my dear, that I passed you without saying good morning;
but I was thinking of something else at the
moment, and only remembered it afterwards!”</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c006'>In speaking of “our dear friend and helper, Miss
Buss,” Miss Cooper, of Edgbaston, takes up the lesson
of the life just closed, as she says—</p>

<p class='c014'>“The whole of the educational world will grieve, and will feel
the void caused by her death. But the full realization of the loss
can only be felt by those who were drawn into the more intimate
personal and professional relations in which Miss Buss showed
her great and generous spirit in the best aspect.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It is of the greatest help to remember the brave and loving
spirit just gone from us, and to recall not only her words of hope
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>and cheer to us, but also her encouragement to take up her work
when it had perforce to be given up; and, in our turn, to help the
younger members of our profession both in their own daily needs
and difficulties, and also in their endeavour after a life that should
realize the highest ideals with which such leaders as Miss Buss
have inspired us.</p>

<p class='c017'>“From such help as she gave us, one learns the gospel of helpfulness
for others, and her life has inspired, and will continue to
inspire, some of the best work that has made education a real and
valuable thing for the women of England—work which has still
to develop into greater usefulness as greater opportunities are
presented to it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And, over and over, from the younger members of
the association, come in varying form the same heartfelt
utterances of personal loss, as in this—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I cannot tell you how much she helped me from the first time
I met her, when I went from the Cambridge Training College to
work under her at her own school, till I left to become head of the
West Ham School. There I rejoiced in having her as one of my
governors, and there she has given me help and encouragement
that I never can repay. But I know I am only one of <i>many</i> whom
she taught and advised without a thought of the trouble to herself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Never, surely, had formal vote of condolence less of
mere form, or more of love and sorrow than that sent
by the Head-mistresses’ Association to the friends of
their “honoured and beloved president,” as they say—</p>

<p class='c014'>“As a body, we lament the loss of our head; as individuals, we
mourn a dear and honoured friend, who, whether in the cause of
public progress or of private friendship, was ever ready to spend
herself, her time, and thought for others, and share with them the
fruits of her sound judgment and experience.</p>

<p class='c017'>“We appreciate most thoroughly the splendid work that she
accomplished in the sphere of education, and the important part
she played in gaining for women the great educational advantages
which they now enjoy, but for the moment we are more disposed
to dwell upon her personal influence, her wide sympathies, her
never-failing readiness to give help and counsel, her public spirit,
and her loyal, affectionate disposition.”</p>

</div>
<p class='c014'>“That human beings, whether male or female, come into the world not
merely to ‘get a living,’ but to live; that the life they live depends largely
on what they know and care about, upon the breadth of their intellectual
sympathy, upon their love of truth, upon their power of influencing and
inspiring other minds; and that, for these reasons, mental culture stands
in just as close relation to the needs of a woman’s career in the world as to
that of a man—all these are propositions which, if not self-evident, are at
least seen in a clearer light by the people of our generation than by their
predecessors.”—<span class='sc'>J. G. Fitch.</span></p>
<p class='c023'>“The thing that vexes me is the entirely ignoring Miss Emily
Davies, to whose hard work it may fairly be said the whole movement
is due. She memorialized the Endowed Schools Commission
to include girls in their inquiries; she bore the brunt of the fight
about getting the Cambridge Local Examinations open, and she
called Girton into existence.”</p>
<p class='c005'>So wrote Miss Buss to Dr. J. G. Fitch, in 1879, when
roused to protest against some statements in a book
entitled, “Girls and Colleges for Women,” which appeared
at that date, and especially to protest against
what invariably roused her deepest ire—the failure to
give honour where honour was due. Of her it might
always be said that she fulfilled the lovely law of
Christian life, “In honour preferring one another.”
As Miss Davies says, in reference to the passage just
quoted, “It was like Miss Buss, so full as she was of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>generosity, to be eager in protest against what she
regarded as a slight to another, not herself.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Constantly recurrent, in speech and in writing, do
we find testimony of the value attached by Miss Buss
to the University Local Examinations, of which she was
among the first to make use.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was in consequence of the exertions of Miss
Davies, assisted by Miss Bostock, of Bedford College,
and a small band of steady supporters, that, in 1863,
girls were, for the <i>first</i> time, and in an informal way,
allowed to try the examination papers set for boys.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c018'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f17'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r17'>17</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Extract from the first circular—</p>

<p class='c020'>“A committee of ladies and gentlemen interested in female education
have made arrangements for holding examinations of girls in connection
with the University of Cambridge, commencing December 14. Prizes and
certificates of proficiency will be awarded by the committee, following the
recommendations of the examiners.</p>

<p class='c020'>“The examinations will be conducted in accordance with the Regulations
of the Cambridge Local Examination, but in a private manner and under
the superintendence of the ladies of the committee.</p>

<p class='c020'>“The committee included the names of Miss Bostock, Miss Isa Craig,
Russell Gurney, Esq., G. W. Hastings, Esq., James Heywood, Esq., Dr.
Hodgson, Mrs. Manning, Mrs. Hensleigh Wedgwood, Mr. H. R. Tomkinson,
Esq., with Lady Goldsmid as treasurer, and Miss Emily Davies as
hon. sec. The same committee worked for Girton College, with the
addition of Lady Stanley of Alderley, Lady Augusta Stanley, Miss Shirreff,
Mrs. Russell Gurney, Miss Ponsonby, Miss Rich, Miss F. Metcalfe, Mr.
Bryce, Mr. Roby, and Mr. Gorst.”</p>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It was not then known if they were even capable of
the necessary mental effort. The result, however, proved
so satisfactory that the next year saw the formation of
a “London Centre for Girls,” of which Miss Davies was
honorary secretary until Girton took up her time, when
she was succeeded by Mrs. Wm. Burbury.</p>

<p class='c006'>To the first irregular examination in 1863 Miss Buss
sent in 25 girls out of the total of 80. Much to her
surprise, ten of her pupils failed in arithmetic, with
the result that she so reorganized her system of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>teaching that henceforth few of her girls failed in that
subject.</p>

<p class='c006'>Between the years 1871 and 1892 no less than 1496
pupils passed in the Cambridge Local Examinations, of
whom 494 took honours.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is an amusing letter to Miss Davies just before
the examination of 1865, which shows how these things
looked thirty years ago—</p>

<div class='c024'>“12, Camden Street, Dec. 5, 1865.</div>
<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>My dear Miss Davies</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“Pray excuse my not answering your note till now. I
am literally ‘over head and ears’ in work. There is so much to
look after just now.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Those dreadful Cambridge examiners! Their digestion
would certainly be impaired if they only knew how indignant I
am with them. Why, the time hitherto allowed for an examination
is an ‘insult’ to us; but now they have added ‘injury,’ by
curtailing the time for English subjects—English, too! <i>The</i> subject
in which a girl might hope to pass with credit! But we must
endure it, as we can’t cure it.</p>

<p class='c017'>“No doubt <i>you</i> are blissfully ignorant of the change. You are
not an unfortunate school-mistress, with a reputation to maintain!</p>

<p class='c017'>“And our girls! We sometimes think they have taken leave
of their senses. Either we have taken up too much, or they are
hopelessly stupid. I almost fear the former.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Is the Cambridge Exam. to take place at that room in
Conduit Street? And, please let the unhappy victims have plenty
of paper before the bell rings. And I hope Miss Craig or Miss
Bostock, or some one, will be there to help you in distributing the
examination papers, wherever there is any English going on, for
even one minute is worth something when the time is so limited.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I hope this is not asking too much; it is for <i>all</i>, at any
rate....</p>
<p class='c030'>“Believe me,</p>
<p class='c031'>“‘Genuinely and heartily’ yours,</p>
<p class='c026'>“My dear Miss Davies,</p>
<p class='c027'>“<span class='sc'>Frances M. Buss</span>.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I mean to worry, worry, worry for a <i>carte de visite</i> of you.
If you do not give way, then I shall worry, worry, worry Mrs.
Davies.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>In the same letter Miss Buss says—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am half-inclined to think of trying inspection next year on
our own account; the expense would, however, be one consideration,
but the experiment would be worth trying.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In 1864, Miss Buss had been inspected by Mr.
Fearon, on behalf of the Schools Inquiry Commission,
and her account of it to her sister is very characteristic.
That the inspector did not share her own estimate of
her girls is proved by the place given to her school, and
by the invitation to appear before the Commissioners
in 1865.</p>

<div class='c024'>“Camden Street, June 24, 1864.</div>

<p class='c017'>“Mr. Fearon is such a nice man! I like him much (as I said
to Miss Begbie, I have taken to liking people lately: Economics,
I suppose). He knows what he is about; is quick without being
abrupt; and most certainly taught me a good deal. It was really
wonderful to see how rapidly he arrived at an estimate. The
morning was spent in getting information out of me about the
history, birth, growth, management, income, etc., of the school.</p>

<p class='c017'>“He went, however, to calisthenics, and also through all the
rooms, counting those who were present, and comparing them
with the registers. After lunch, he examined the upper third in
arithmetic, dictation, reading, geography, requesting Miss —— to
give a history lesson before him.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The children did the wildest things! I could have annihilated
them over and over again. One young monkey said the
‘Artic’ Ocean was in some ridiculous place. He said, ‘What?’
She answered, ‘Artic.’ He said, ‘Spell it!’ To which, with the
most graceful complaisance, she said ‘a-r-t-i-c.’ Was she not a
wretch? Miss ——’s lesson was horrible—she dropped a few <i>h</i>’s, and
asked foolish questions, which produced equally absurd answers.
For instance, she asked some question about the death of Rufus,
to which the reply was, ‘Oh, they carried him away in a dustcart!’
‘William the Conqueror left the Holy Land to Robert.’
When corrected, the children said, ‘Oh, well, it was Canaan.’</p>

<p class='c017'>“They were restless and fidgety, did not obey orders; and,
in fact, were as dreadful as they could be. If the first class do not
acquit themselves relatively better, our report will be a queer one.
I have made an appeal to them.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>“The inspection has produced the pleasing result that our
children are not <i>near</i> the average of the same age in a National
School. No grant under the revised code would be given to us.
Charming, is it not? In spelling, for instance, the National
School children are allowed only an average of one mistake in a
class. Our little ones made eight and a half <i>each</i> instead of <i>one</i>
each. In arithmetic, the standard is half a mistake, and ours
made two and a half. The copy-books were reported as bad;
everything was bad! But I do not mind, provided the elder girls
come out well.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The next experience does not seem to have been
much happier, for on July 7 she says—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I could not write yesterday. There were so many callers,
and the fact is that, since the inspection of yesterday, I have
collapsed, bodily and mentally!</p>

<p class='c017'>“The heat, too, is dreadful, and I am quite overdone with it.
The whole of last evening and this morning, except for an hour,
I lay half unconscious on the bed or sofa, incapable of reading,
thinking, or sleeping. I am in a state of tears whenever I think
of Wednesday. I do not say the girls have not done well. In
comparison, probably, with others, <i>very</i> well; but they did not do
their best.</p>

<p class='c017'>“In a really easy arithmetic paper, not one, or only one, touched
the decimals. In history, they sat doing <i>nothing</i> for twenty minutes,
although there was a question, ‘The dates of following battles.’
Actually, <i>not one</i> girl in my division attempted to give the least
account of the battle, or result, or anything about it but the bare
date, which, of course, in half the cases, would be wrong; because
in our examinations, they said, it was of no use to do more than
the absolute answer to the question. Is it not cruel to me, after
my life has been given to the work?”</p>

<p class='c005'>A letter dated 1869, five years later, shows how
Miss Buss must have profited by the experience of this
inspection, for she writes in very good spirits of the
results of the Cambridge Local Examinations—</p>

<p class='c014'>“All our girls have passed except one. Six of Miss Metcalfe’s
have passed, one with second class, and one with third class
honours. My list is good. Esther Greatbatch has first class, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>two have third class. Of seniors, two have third class; so we have
five honours. Three of the girls are distinguished in Religious
Knowledge. On the whole we have done well.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In 1876, after another inspection, the tone changes
again, and we find, in comparing 1864 with 1876, that
the times have changed also. Miss Buss thus writes
to me, during the inspection, which seems to have been
enlivened by suppers, in which the girls showed off their
domestic accomplishments, everything, including bread,
being made by their own hands—</p>

<p class='c014'>“You cannot imagine how much the inspection puts on me.
Luckily, we like our examiner <i>very</i> much indeed, and that lightens
our work. Shall I say this, after seeing his report? He must find
fault—that is the business of inspectors—their <i>raison d’être</i>. If
he finds defects, the existence of which I do not suspect, I shall
not mind so much, because that will be a case of living and learning.
But I am conceited enough to think that I could be an
inspector myself! We had a fine supper last night, cooked by
the lady-cooks! They were <i>so</i> happy! Ella will tell you all
about it some time.”</p>

<p class='c005'>That particular report does not happen to be before
me, but there is a letter from one of H.M. Inspectors
of Schools, written to Miss Buss, in 1887, which may
stand as representative—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I had the pleasure of visiting the North London Collegiate
School last week, under the able guidance of Miss Dillys Davies.
I was very sorry not to see you, so that I might express to you
how delighted I was with all I saw. I have seen no better
appointed school. I have long considered your school—judged
by results—as the best girls’ school in England, but I <i>had</i> never
seen the admirable rooms and apparatus.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I have often named the school to lady-friends, but I find that
there is still, alas! a terrible blindness as to what constitutes true
education, and the unfortunate girls are sent to be finished in the
usual orthodox way in the usually indifferent establishments.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>“Permit me to add one more congratulation (to the thousands
you must have already received) in appreciation of the noble work
you are doing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The advance was strikingly rapid. In 1863, it was
not even known whether girls were able to undertake
the work required for the Cambridge Local Examinations.
Even in 1876, Miss Buss writes thus of the
results, which had not quite satisfied the honorary
secretary of her centre, as compared with those of the
year before—</p>

<p class='c014'>“But please remember that last year the senior Cambridge
girls formed the <i>highest</i> class; this year there are thirty-two girls
in a higher division, studying for the London University Matriculation.
Our girls have this year, in the greater number of cases,
gone up at sixteen, instead of seventeen, and that makes a difference.
We shall send up twelve or fourteen for the Matriculation
in May. Sara Burstall, two terms only from Camden School, and
<i>my</i> scholar, gets half the £12 prize offered to the best senior girls.
Mr. Browne wrote to me to say so. I ought to be content.”</p>

<p class='c005'>For some years Miss Buss sent her pupils to the
first London centre at Burlington House, where Miss
Davies was very much struck by the way in which
she—who had done so much to forward the movement—took
her place simply and quietly among the others,
whose part had been merely to accept what had been
done for them.</p>

<p class='c006'>But when the school in Camden Road had acquired
rooms large enough to meet the Cambridge requirements,
Miss Buss considered it would be well to form
a new centre, and asked me to undertake the correspondence
involved. Miss Davies writes in reply to
my first note—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Your suggestion of a centre for North London strikes me as
an admirable one. I should like to have a <i>cordon</i> of centres all
round London, and we seem now to be making a beginning to it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>Would it be possible to have also a St. John’s Wood Centre? We
found last year that Bayswater was of no use to St. John’s Wood.
Whether this district would produce enough candidates to support
a centre of its own I do not know.... I am so glad you are
taking up this matter so energetically and judiciously.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In July, 1872, Miss Buss sent me a list of ladies
who had agreed to act as the committee of the <i>Regent’s
Park Centre</i>. When we remember that the duties
included attendance for the honorary secretary from
9 a.m. till 9 p.m., for three or four days out of the six,
and that two or more ladies of the committee must be
present whenever an examination is going on, it will
be seen that this meant work. This first list met
with warm approval from the Rev. G. F. Browne, at
Cambridge, as showing the interest taken in the then
new movement by persons known in the educational
world. We find here the names of Mrs. Charlton
Bastian, Mrs. Fox Bourne, Miss Orme, Mrs. Percy
Bunting, Mrs. J. G. Fitch, Mrs. Hales, Mrs. Henry
Morley, and Mrs. Williamson. Mrs. Avery, Miss Sarah
Ward Andrews, Miss Agnes Jones, Miss Swan, and
myself completed the first list. My sister, Miss J. T.
Ridley, was appointed honorary secretary, and remained
in this post till 1894, when she was succeeded
by Miss Hester Armstead, who had been a most successful
candidate in both Junior and Senior Examinations,
before distinguishing herself in the Cambridge
Classical Tripos.</p>

<p class='c006'>The number of candidates increased so rapidly that,
in 1873, it was necessary to arrange an Islington Centre
to take the North London pupils, and, in 1874, to open
the St. John’s Wood and Hampstead Centre, of which
Miss Swan became the able honorary secretary for over
twenty years. If we could have foreseen such results,
the name of <i>Regent’s Park Centre</i> would never have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>been given to the original centre, which would have
been known, from the first—as what it so soon became—the
centre for the pupils of Miss Buss’ schools
only.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is a letter from Miss Buss, in reference to the
one difficulty which ever occurred at this centre, which
has interest in showing her on both sides: the gracious
and the severe. A girl had broken the rules, and
was, therefore, condemned to forfeit her examination,
the honorary secretary pleading in vain against this
fiat—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Just a line, dear Jeanie, to express to you, on my own part
and that of the teachers in the Cambridge Forms, my and their
hearty thanks for all the work you have done for us this week.
Everything has gone <i>admirably</i>, and my share of the work was
never less burdensome. Indeed, <i>I</i> have had nothing to do with
the Cambridge work except look on!</p>

<p class='c017'>“Do not think me a monster, but, of all the hard lessons I have
had to learn, none has been so hard as the one which makes me,
<i>for the moment</i>, not only refuse sympathy, but actually speak
harshly—if there is a stronger word I would use it. In the years
to come, I hope many a woman will thank me in her heart for
behaving harshly to her in her girlhood, in all matters of tears or
want of self-control, and so putting before her another ideal: that
of the woman strong to bear, to endure, to suffer, rather than that
of the weak woman always ready to give way at the least difficulty.
<i>Afterwards</i> I always reason out the whole matter; but it is <i>always
afterwards</i>; never at the time.</p>

<p class='c017'>“My love to you, Annie, and your father.</p>
<p class='c030'>“Always yours affectionately,</p>
<p class='c031'>“<span class='sc'>Frances M. Buss</span>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The following note to Miss Buss from one of the
examiners of the <i>Regent’s Park Centre</i> shows how much
she had to do with the decision to print the girls’ names,
as the boys’ names had always been printed; a step
then regarded as a rather alarming innovation:—</p>

<div class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>“March 2, 1874.</div>
<p class='c025'>“I have had some conversation with the other members
of the Local Examinations Syndicate, and I think I am warranted
in expressing an opinion that if the subject of the printing of the
girls’ names in the published lists were again brought before the
Syndicate by a representation signed by influential local secretaries
and others who are interested in the question, it would meet with
a different solution than it has done heretofore, thanks to the
remarks you have made to me of your own experience.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I told Mr. Browne in our last conversation that I thought the
best way to bring the matter before us again would be for me to
write to you, and give you an intimation of the present feeling, and
you would know through whom to move.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In the same spirit in which she had entered into
the Cambridge Local Examinations did Miss Buss
throw herself into the larger work which soon engrossed
Miss Davies, viz. the development of Girton College.
The members of the Kensington Society were the first
supporters of this movement, one of the leaders being
Mrs. Manning, who, with Miss Davies and Mr. Sedley
Taylor, and Mr. Tomkinson, took part in the first
meeting of a committee, on December 5, 1867, to consider
“A Proposed College for Women.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In 1869 a house was taken at Hitchin, where five
students were received, Mrs. Manning acting for the
first three months as Lady Principal. She was succeeded,
for the next year, by Miss Emily Shirreff, who relates
that a proposition to go as missionary to Fiji would at
that time have caused less amazement to her friends
than this venture into untried ways. Miss Davies
herself was the first Head at Girton.</p>

<p class='c006'>The effort to obtain the £13,000 required for the
new buildings was, like all other early efforts of the
kind, a work of courage and patience. The first £1000
was given by Madame Bodichon, and the same sum by
Miss E. A. Manning, while £8000 had been collected by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>the committee. One of the things hard to bear by those
who had made it possible to take such a step was the
foundation of the new Holloway College, with magnificent
buildings for which there were then no students,
whilst Girton was still struggling for the merely necessary
accommodation needed for its students actually in
residence.</p>

<p class='c006'>Occupied as she was with the same effort to obtain
funds for her own schools, Miss Buss could not give
much pecuniary help. But she did help very largely
by her influence, being always and everywhere an able
propagandist of the new ideas.</p>

<p class='c006'>Side by side with the Girton movement went another
which began with a set of lectures started by the Cambridge
Ladies’ Association, in January, 1870, to enable
women-students to take advantage of the instruction
offered by Trinity College. For the accommodation of
ladies attending these lectures a house in Cambridge
was taken by Mr. Sidgwick, Miss Clough being placed
at the head of it. This beginning, known as Merton
Hall, developed rapidly into the present Newnham
College, with its now fine building, possessing the
advantage over Girton—which is distant three miles out
of Cambridge—of being within easy access to all the
advantages of the University.</p>

<p class='c006'>The work at Newnham differs from that at Girton
in offering a special examination for women, under the
authorization of the University and with certificates,
but not demanding the same work from women that
was imperative for men.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the first, Miss Davies and her friends—Miss
Buss being very firm on this point—had steadily resisted
every offer that made a separation between men and
women. They demanded for women the very same
curriculum as that expected from men. The trend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>of public opinion has on the whole been in this direction
during the later progress of the movement, and although
several difficult questions are still to be solved, few now
doubt that in the beginning it was expedient to make
the demand in the form in which it was made.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Buss made frequent visits to Girton and to
Newnham, having a succession of pupils there. I
remember her enjoyment, as well as my own, as she took
me to see them for the first time, when we lunched at
Girton with Miss Bernard, and afterwards had tea with
Miss Clough, at Newnham; in both Colleges being shown
about by old pupils, delighted to show their pretty
rooms to their dear friend.</p>

<p class='c006'>The present head of Girton writes, now that these
visits are of the past—</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is not merely the thought of what, with her great abilities
and vast stores of experience, she might still have accomplished, if
she had been spared in health and strength till old age overtook
her, but the feeling that the world and her friends are so much
poorer by the loss of one of the best and truest women that ever
lived, that fills me with regret. As you know, it has been my
privilege to count her among my staunchest friends, and I feel
that to me, at least, one unfailing source of sympathy and support
is lost now that she is gone. There are others who can tell better
than I can what her help meant to the college in early days. I
know well how much it has owed to her in later times, and in how
many ways we shall miss her now.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Helen Gladstone gives another side of the
work—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I sincerely wish that I could show my respect and affection
for Miss Buss by attending either or both services to-morrow;
but I am too far off to make it possible. I most truly lament her
death, and I feel most grateful to her for her splendid work for
not merely education, but Church education. It was in connection
with such work that I knew her best, and gained the privilege of
forming a friendship with her.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>I have been favoured by Mr. Menzies with an interesting
account of an experiment of great importance
in the early days of the University movement, in which
Miss Buss took an active part. When Miss Davies
first propounded her scheme to the School-Mistresses’
Association, it was regarded by most of the members as
a thing impossible. Mrs. Menzies, one of the members,
was known to have been educated by her father, Dr.
King, on the same lines as his boy-pupils. Her classmates,
as men, won University honours, while Mrs.
Menzies went on with her studies at home with so
much success that in after life she was able to act as
a classical “coach” to young men preparing for the
University.</p>

<p class='c006'>Her opinion of the subject of the University career
for girls was naturally of weight; and she was asked to
answer these two important questions—</p>

<p class='c014'>“(1) Could girls, beginning their classical studies at fourteen
or fifteen years of age, be able to hold their ground when placed
in competition with young men who had begun the same studies
in their eighth or ninth year? (2) Would it be necessary to alter
the entire system of teaching in girls’ schools, so as to make
classics the dominant study from the age at which boys usually
began?”</p>

<p class='c005'>As Mrs. Menzies was unacquainted with everything
connected with girls’ schools, she was unable to give
any definite opinion. She had taught Latin and Greek
to a few ladies, but these had always been above the
schoolgirl age.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here Miss Buss’ practical turn of mind came to the
rescue. She first proposed that Mrs. Menzies should
take a senior class in the North London School, and
make the experiment; and when she found that Mrs.
Menzies was unable to give the time required for going
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>to Camden Town, she then chartered an omnibus, and
sent the pupils to the teacher.</p>

<p class='c006'>We hear that, at first, the size of the class rather
alarmed Mrs. Menzies, but—</p>

<p class='c014'>“she soon felt at ease with girls so sympathetic, earnest, and intelligent.
She determined to keep them to Latin exclusively, and
see how far she could carry them on in the limited time, without
strain. Long before the end of the term, she came to the conclusion
that girls, trained as these had been, could easily, by the
time they were admissible to the University, be perfectly able to
pass the preliminary examination, and do as well as the freshmen
who usually go up for it. She was of opinion that the time given
by boys to athletics lost them the advantage which their six or
seven years’ earlier start might otherwise have given them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Menzies concludes—</p>

<p class='c014'>“This important experiment, which the foresight and management
of Miss Buss made possible, showed the school-mistresses
that these pupils could obtain the advantage of University training
without any alteration of their studies up to fourteen or fifteen
years of age. In consequence, such of the school-mistresses who
had hesitated about Miss Davies’ University scheme, were reconciled
to it, and, in course of time, approved of it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In February, 1873, there is a report in the <i>Union
Journal</i> of the first examination for the Mathematical
Tripos, held at Cambridge, in connection with Girton
College. Miss S. Woodhead was examined, by the
official examiners, in their private capacity, and they
reported on her papers according to the University
standards. The marks assigned would have placed
Miss Woodhead among the senior optimes, <i>i.e.</i> in the
second class of mathematical honours. In April, 1873,
Miss Cook and Miss Lumsden took what would have
been second- and third-class honours.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the usual Convocation of the University of
London, held on May 12, 1874, Dr. Storrar presiding,
it was moved by the Rev. Septimus Buss, and finally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>resolved, “That, in the opinion of Convocation, it is
desirable that women should be permitted to take
degrees in the University of London.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This resolution was warmly supported by that unfailing
friend of the higher education of women, Dr.
J. G. Fitch, who stood his ground against the not less
warm opposition, headed by Dr. Quain, who, referring
to Mrs. Somerville, asked “if the University was to go
for a new charter just to further the ambition of a few
exceptional women?” Dr. Gibson, also in opposition,
urged that a woman could not take up a University
course without detracting from her other powers, for, as
woman was differently organized, it was necessary to
give her a different education; and he asked “if the
University was to direct its work by general wants, or
by exceptional wants—the wants of a few masculine
women?”</p>

<p class='c006'>From the fact that many of Miss Buss’ pupils were
resident in London, it followed that most of them were
likely to avail themselves of the facilities of the London
University, even apart from the fact that London was
the first to grant degrees, an event of great excitement
to all women, of which Miss Buss writes in 1878—</p>

<p class='c014'>“The great thing of last week is the opening of the examinations
and degrees of London University to women! An immense
concession, and one which must be followed in time by the older
universities.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It is just fifteen years ago since the agitation began about
opening the local examinations, and now, I suppose, the cause is
won along the whole line.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In a “Note on the Origin and History of the University
of London” (<i>University Calendar</i>), we find this
record—</p>

<p class='c014'>“The experiment of offering encouragement for women to
pursue a course of academic education, was at first tried under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>limitations which somewhat impeded its success. Under the
powers given in the Charter of 1867, women were not rendered
admissible to the ordinary examinations, but two forms of certificate
were offered to female students—the one general, and the
other of higher proficiency. In the scheme for both examinations,
prominence was given to those subjects which it was presumed
that women and their teachers would prefer. But the number
availing themselves of this privilege was small, and the privilege
itself was not highly valued. Moreover, it was found that the
chief distinctions attained by women in these examinations were
not gained in the special subjects, but in the classical languages
and in science. It was urged by the teachers that women did not
desire a scheme of instruction exclusively devised for their use,
but would prefer to have access to the ordinary degrees and
honours, and to be subject to the same tests of qualification which
were imposed on other students.</p>

<p class='c017'>“After much discussion, the Senate and Convocation agreed
to accept from the Crown, in 1878, a Supplemental Charter, making
every degree, honour, and prize awarded by the University accessible
to students of both sexes on perfectly equal terms. The
University of London was thus the first academical body in the
United Kingdom to admit women as candidates for degrees. The
record of the results which have followed this measure will be
found in the statistical tables and in the honours and distinctions
which have since been won by female candidates.”</p>

<p class='c005'>On the point of granting degrees, on the same
terms for women as for men, Miss Buss was always
most decided. She endeavoured to carry the Head-mistresses’
Association with her in presenting a
memorial to the University authorities, but in this she
failed, as is shown in the following letter to Miss
Davies—</p>

<div class='c024'>“Myra Lodge, July 24, 1877.</div>
<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>My dear Miss Davies</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“It was so impossible to agree at our committee yesterday
that we gave up the idea of sending a memorial from the
Head-mistresses’ Association.</p>

<p class='c017'>“At the committee, only five would vote for the degree on
absolutely equal terms, and eight were against it. Of the absent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>members five wrote against it, so there would have been a large
<i>majority against</i>.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Each mistress can sign the memorial she prefers. So, I
suppose, ‘we,’ that is, my colleagues and I, had better sign your
memorial.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I heard, for the first time, that men from the affiliated colleges—Nottingham,
for example—could get a degree without the
Little-Go, and with only two years’ residence. This, if correct, does
modify things a little. I heard, also, that Dr. Sidgwick would
vote for the degree being given on the same terms as now, <i>i.e.</i> I
suppose, on Girton and Newnham lines.</p>
<p class='c030'>“Yours always truly,</p>
<p class='c031'>“<span class='sc'>Frances M. Buss</span>.</p>

<p class='c017'>“My young people were delighted with their visit to Girton.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In a letter to Dr. Fitch, dated July 24, 1879, Miss
Buss thus expresses her satisfaction with the success of
the efforts in this direction—</p>

<div class='c024'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Mr. Fitch</span>,</div>
<p class='c025'>“Many thanks for your kind note, which gave me
great pleasure. I am glad to know that our friends are satisfied
with the result of their exertions on our behalf so far.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The fight was hard. I wonder how the women will do in the
B.A. and B.Sc. Examinations.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Cheltenham has done as well as usual. Nine candidates out
of ten passed in this last matriculation examination.</p>

<p class='c017'>“<i>We</i> are exceptionally fortunate this year, but our success is
largely owing to my accomplished and brilliant young fellow-worker,
Mrs. Bryant, who is as good and charming as she is
clever.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I thank you most heartily for your congratulations, dear
Mr. Fitch.</p>
<p class='c030'>“Believe me,</p>
<p class='c031'>“Yours always truly,</p>
<p class='c026'>“<span class='sc'>Frances M. Buss</span>.</p>

<p class='c017'>“To J. G. Fitch, Esq., M.A.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In 1881, Mrs. Grey writes to Miss Buss from
Naples, on the receipt of the <i>Cambridge Calendar</i>—</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>“This scheme seems as good as we could expect, and embracing
all the most important points so contended for. On the
whole, when I recollect the indifference, and sometimes the contemptuous
opposition that one met with, even when I first read
a paper on the subject, some six years ago, I think the progress
has been unexpectedly rapid; and it will be indefinitely accelerated
when the Universities (or Cambridge alone) have published
their scheme.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It is only by carefully contrasting the state of girls’
education in 1863 with what, in 1895, is accepted as the
natural order of things, that we can estimate duly the
value of the work done by the leaders in this movement,
amongst whom prominent places must be assigned
to Emily Davies and Frances Mary Buss.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have a pleasant little glimpse of the relations
that existed between the two friends in a note found
among Miss Buss’ most treasured possessions, with a
piece of needlework, marked in her writing, as “worked
by Miss Davies.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“8, Harewood Square, Dec. 20, 1890.</div>
<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Miss Buss</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“I am sending you, in a separate packet, marked, ‘to
await return,’ in case you have already left town, a chair-back,
which I have had great pleasure in working for you. Will you
accept it as a small token of affection and good will? I have
thought much of you while putting in the stitches, and of the
high and noble qualities which I have had so many opportunities
of observing during our long and unbroken friendship.</p>

<p class='c017'>“All Christmas blessings to you and yours.</p>
<p class='c030'>“Ever yours sincerely,</p>
<p class='c031'>“<span class='sc'>Emily Davies</span>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>As a summing-up of Miss Buss’ attitude with regard
to this great question, I am indebted to Mrs. Bryant
for the following remarks which embody the results
of many a consultation between the head and her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>sympathetic colleague, whose own career is so strikingly
illustrative of the whole question:—</p>

<p class='c014'>“In the earlier years of the Cambridge Colleges, Miss Buss
was one of the most ardent supporters of the attempt to win for
women admission to the opportunities and recognition of the older
Universities. The part she took was the very useful one of supplying
students trained in her school, few of whom would probably
have gone on to a college career but for the stimulus of her advice
and encouragement. Times have greatly changed since then.
At that time there was a small band of women bent on carrying
out an ideal which is now partly fulfilled, and very widely accepted,
and there were a few girls, growing into womanhood, with the
eager thirst for knowledge that defies obstacles. These latter
were the first Cambridge students. But the great mass of social
feeling was hostile, or at the best contentedly acquiescent in the
existing state of affairs. It was for the conversion of this conservatively
acquiescent, but not hostile, feeling, that missionary effort
was needed, and Miss Buss, among her girls and their parents, was
the most ardent and convincing of missionaries. She would captivate
intellectually, and persuade morally, the girl whom she saw as
destined for the higher intellectual things, and she would educate
or persuade the parents to take her view, or at any rate, give it a
trial. As a matter of course, we now ask of an elder girl in school
what she intends to do in her after-career, and the majority of
girls, or their parents, have some idea, or are trying to form one.
But in the early seventies it was not so, and Miss Buss created
ideals of the future for individuals out of little more than her
perception of their capabilities.</p>

<p class='c017'>“With regard to the difference of ideal end between the two
Cambridge Colleges, Miss Buss, with her usual balance and
moderation, held that the greater liberty, as regards time of
residence and studies, allowed at Newnham, was very serviceable
to a large class of students, especially at the beginning, whose
circumstances and opportunities did not allow that they should
completely carry out the regular University conditions. But she
had, nevertheless, no doubt at all that the full University course,
and the University degree as its recognition, was the end to be
achieved by all who could achieve it. If the University were in
need of reform, if more liberty should be allowed as regards Greek
in particular, then, it seemed to her, that question should be fought
out for both sexes alike, since there was no peculiar reason why
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>women specially should abstain from the classics. But, to her mind,
the over-balancing consideration was that the principle of equality
in the race for such intellectual privileges as could be won, should
be broadly asserted in the most emphatic way—‘a fair fight, and
no favour,’ as she often said. She made no assumption about the
extent of the average woman’s powers, but she smiled over the <i>à
priori</i> views, once so common, which settled beforehand what
their tastes should be—for literature, for botany, perhaps, for
modern languages, certainly not for mathematics. So her sympathies,
regarding the ultimate end to be attained, leaned to the
system of Girton College, which fulfilled all the University conditions,
and, pending the grant by the University of degrees,
stamped each Girton student with a mark equivalent to graduation
in all respects. The unlimited liberty of choice allowed to the
women students at Oxford was, to her, a great stumbling-block.
‘It is impossible to follow the variety of the Oxford course in all
its windings,’ she would say; ‘or to make out clearly what an
Oxford woman has done.’ And there can be no doubt that the
Oxford women who have done the best courses do suffer seriously
in the practical world by the very indefinite character of the
general stamp they wear. This, indeed, has come to be an important
argument in favour of the grant of the Oxford degree to
the fully qualified women.</p>

<p class='c017'>“In these latter years, however, she, like others, felt that there
was hope of great things, educationally, in the development of
thought among the younger generation at Oxford. How deeply
interested she was in the Conference on Secondary Education at
Oxford! It was a great disappointment to her that on account of
illness she could not be present. Telling her all about it afterwards
was part of the conference to me.</p>

<p class='c017'>“As regards the stumbling-block of compulsory Greek, it may
be worth while to say a word here which should tend to dispel the
fear that the requirement of Greek at the Universities will make
Greek a necessary class-subject in the first-grade schools. It has
not had this effect so far, I believe, in any of the schools supplying
students to Girton. Only the small band of girls destined for a
University course make it a study. In our practice at the North
London Collegiate School, it is alternative with French, as Latin
is with German; and it always comes late in the course. We see,
however, that it is taught well, very well, when it comes.</p>

<p class='c017'>“On May 15, 1878, on the occasion of the presentation of degrees
at the University of London, the Chancellor, Lord Granville
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>made the great announcement that henceforth women should be
eligible for all the degrees and honours of the University. I
was with Miss Buss in the gallery; it was a thrilling moment. The
concession was unexpected, and it was so perfectly complete.
There were no reservations in it, no locked doors, no exclusion from
rights in the government of the University, or from eligibility for
any of its posts. The time for experiment was over, and the test
had been approved; the time for half-measures was over too.
There never was a concession more freely or more graciously
made, and with a largeness of wisdom and sympathy which cannot
be honoured too much.</p>

<p class='c017'>“At the same time, it was announced that the University would
institute a diploma for teachers, and thus another much-desired
end was also fulfilled. ‘I care for that almost as much,’ she said.
But the prime interest centred in the grant of the degrees. How
overjoyed she was! ‘What will <i>you</i> do?’ she said to me. ‘I will
learn Latin,’ I said; ‘matriculate in January, and go on for the
Doctor of Science degree in Philosophy.’</p>

<p class='c017'>“In later years we did not sit in the gallery, however late we
came, but in the front row. She never failed to come, not even
last year, when, indeed, she found the effort trying. It was such
a pleasure to her, year by year, to see the number of girl-graduates
grow; and she rejoiced as much in the success of others as in
that of her own flock. It was characteristic of her selflessness, her
magnanimity, that, instead of presenting her distinguished pupils
herself, she handed over to me from the first that honourable duty.
‘She liked it better so,’ she said. But thus it was in all things:
wherever there was honour, she put me forward to share it. For
herself she sought nothing.”</p>

</div>
<p class='c014'>“The science of education, so little thought of, so contemptuously
ignored, is the crowning science of all, for it is the application of all the
sciences to the production of the highest result—the perfect man.”—From
a paper read by Mrs. Grey at the meeting of the British Association, 1874.</p>
<p class='c015'>In 1873, the theory and practice of education were
still so far apart that, in the March number of <i>The
Journal of the Women’s Education Union</i> of that year,
we find the following very definite statement:—</p>
<p class='c014'>“Training colleges do not exist; the expense of founding them
would place them almost hopelessly out of reach, though something
might have been done by following up the example of the Home
and Colonial in their private department. Mrs. Wm. Grey proposed
a plan for a class of student teachers to form part of every
large school, which was adopted by the Public Day-school Company,
who are, however, not yet in a position to try it. It has also been
approved by Miss Buss and Miss Beale, and is already in operation
in Camden Town.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In October, 1872, Miss Buss and Miss Doreck, the
two ladies on the council of the College of Preceptors,
had brought forward a scheme for establishing a
“Training class of lectures and lessons for teachers;”
and as a consequence of this effort the office of “Professor
of the Science and Art of Education” was offered
to Mr. Joseph Payne, whose inaugural address was given
on January 30, 1873. Miss Buss and Miss Doreck took
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>an active part in bringing together the seventy students
(chiefly women) who attended these lectures. At
Norwich, Dr. Hodgson spoke with strong approval of
the step taken by the College of Preceptors in founding
a professorship of the theory and art of education, and
of their choice of Mr. Payne to fill this post. He spoke
of the success of Mr. Payne’s lectures in London and in
Edinburgh, and expressed a hope that such professorships
would ere long be established “in one or more of
the chief Scottish Universities also,” and added that
“they were strongly to be desired for the English
Universities also.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Of Mr. Payne’s lectures there is a notice in the
March <i>Education Journal</i> of the same year—</p>

<p class='c014'>“The object of the whole course is to show that there are
principles of education on which, in order to be efficient, practice
must be founded; or, in other words, that there is a science of
education, in reference to which the art must be conducted, and the
value of its processes tested.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Buss’ feeling about these lectures is shown in a
letter written in 1876, soon after the death of her much-valued
friend—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Because I have not enough to do, I am working up an attempt
to raise a little memorial to Mr. Payne, the ablest teacher I have
ever known—except Dr. Hodgson—and the man who has raised
the noblest ideal before the profession. It cuts me to the heart
to see his name lost to posterity, and after several fruitless attempts,
it seems I must set the ball rolling. Will you or your father give
something? I want the memorial to be a prize or scholarship in
the new Teachers’ Training Society.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Many a successful head-mistress must thank Miss
Buss for her recommendation to these lectures. Mrs.
Bryant and Miss Cooper, of Edgbaston, were among
the students, and both became Fellows of the College.
A letter from Miss Frances Lord says, in 1873—</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>“I am attending Mr. Payne’s lectures, as you told me to do.
My sister Emily goes too, and, as a teacher, makes remarks that
Mr. Payne thinks well of. If she ever takes up Kindergarten work
(as I want her to do), she will, I am sure, be greatly helped by these
lectures. My friends, the Wards, find, as we do, that the questions
Mr. Payne asks draw largely on common observation such as we
have been practising and have been wanting to know the value of.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Payne called attention to the principles of
Kindergarten work, a subject brought to the front by
Miss Shirreff, who wrote a series of articles in 1874, in
the <i>Journal</i>, leading to the formation of the Frœbel
Society, of which Miss Doreck was the first president,
and Miss E. A. Manning the honorary secretary. Miss
Manning read a paper on the subject at the meeting of
the Social Science Congress, in the same year.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Doreck had been elected—at Miss Buss’ suggestion—on
the council of the College of Preceptors, and
the two worked very heartily together.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c018'><sup>[18]</sup></a> On April 16,
1874, the two ladies formed part of a deputation by
appointment to urge on the Duke of Richmond the
formation of a Training College for Teachers.</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f18'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r18'>18</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Miss Doreck’s special work was Kindergarten teaching, then quite a
novelty in England. Miss Buss once said, “We shall not have thorough
education till we have the Kindergarten;” but she could only help this
movement on by helping others to do it.</p>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The design of the deputation was—</p>
<p class='c023'>“to have the scholastic professors placed on a similar footing to
that of law and physics, and, in order to assist the Government in
effecting that end, the College of Preceptors was ready to undertake
the requisite corresponding functions of the Law Institution,
the College of Surgeons, or a Pharmaceutical Society.”</p>
<p class='c005'>The principle at stake may be considered the central
thought of the whole life of Frances Mary Buss. To
raise the ideal of teaching, and, with this, the status of
the teacher, was the most definite purpose of this life;
and, as means to an end, she recognized from the very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>first the supreme importance of training for the work.
In her youth, the elementary school teacher was the
only person happy enough to receive this preparation
for his duties. All the rest—as was candidly avowed
by one of the foremost schoolmasters of the day—had
to gain their experience at the cost of their first pupils.</p>

<p class='c006'>To her own mother Miss Buss was largely indebted
for the insight which made her a leader in the training-college
movements. When Mrs. Buss decided on
opening her school in Clarence Road, she had the bold
thought of preparing herself for the venture by going
through the course offered at the Home and Colonial
Institute to elementary teachers. At this distance of
time, it is difficult to estimate duly the originality and
the strength of mind implied in such a step. In the
“forties,” the beaten track on which ladies were expected
to walk securely was very straight and very
narrow. But this bold step was taken, and it resulted
in a permanent broadening of the way for all who came
after, since the class for the training of secondary teachers
was a direct result of Mrs. Buss’ own action. In this
class, all the teachers of Miss Buss’ schools received
their training, and it is of interest to note among the
earliest students the names of Anne Clough, the founder
of Newnham College, and of Jane Agnes Chessar, a
teacher of very remarkable power, who was one of the
first ladies elected on the School Board.</p>

<p class='c006'>It might possibly have been due to the influence of
the Rev. David Laing that Mrs. Buss originated her
plan, but the credit remains with her of being the first
in the field of action. The idea of training governesses
was suggested as early as 1843, on the council of the
Governesses’ Benevolent Institution, but no action was
taken before 1848, even to form classes.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have seen that, as early as 1872, Miss Buss had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>the dream of a training college attached to her own
school. This she gave up later in favour of the Maria
Grey Training College. In November, 1872, Miss Beale
writes to her—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I did think much of our conversation about training governesses,
and we have arranged to receive about six on the same
terms as the ‘Home and Colonial.’ They can for this not only
attend here but go to certain lessons on Method at the Normal
Training College.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The Training Department of the Cheltenham Ladies’
College is now one of the distinct branches of work
there, including Kindergarten training, with the novel
feature of a small Kindergarten for children of the
elementary class, serving as a training school.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was not till 1877 that Mrs. Grey succeeded in
opening the college which now bears her name, up to
which she and Miss Shirreff had been working in the
Teachers’ Training and Registration Society, one of the
offshoots of the Women’s Education Union.</p>

<p class='c006'>For details of this work I am indebted to Miss
Shirreff, and also to Miss Agnes J. Ward, one of the
first principals of the college.</p>

<p class='c006'>The council, in addition to Mrs. Grey and Miss
Shirreff, consisted of Miss Chessar, Dr. E. A. Abbott,
Mr. J. H. Rigg, Mr. R. N. Shore, Mr. C. H. Lake, and
Mr. Douglas Galton. The articles of association were
drafted by Mr. William Shaen, who, till his death, in
1886, was a generous and true friend to the college.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Louisa Brough became secretary, under Mrs.
Grey, as organizing secretary. Unhappily, after working
for a year or so, Mrs. Grey’s health broke down,
and she was ordered abroad. It was then that Miss
Buss came to the front, though she had been quietly
helpful from the beginning. Some letters to her from
Rome show Mrs. Grey’s estimate of this help—</p>

<div class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>“23, Piazza de Spagna, Roma,</div>
<div class='c039'>“Feb. 11, 1879.</div>

<p class='c017'>“It is really too good of you, in the midst of your hard-worked
life, to make time for writing me such a charming long letter as I
received a few days ago.... We have left the hotel, and have very
sunny rooms just at the foot of the great stairs. How I wish you
were over the way, where I used to pick you up two years ago.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Except from yourself, we hear hardly anything from the
college. Your hopeful report is a great joy to us, because you
know the difficulties so well that you will never be over sanguine.
How kind it is of you and Miss Chessar to work for it as you do,
and Dr. Abbott deserves more thanks than I can express. I would
like to write to him only I feel it would be imposing on him a letter
to write, and that would be no kindness. Will you tell him this
when you meet, and something of what we both feel about his
generous gift of time and thought to the institution that we have
cared for so earnestly and are driven to forsake.... We must, as
you say, make our scheme as we go along, and large numbers
would be an embarrassment. As to funds, you make no complaint,
and that is comforting.... Once the college is in settled good
work, and the Cambridge scheme is published, I cannot doubt that
many will be found to help.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Grey was never strong enough to return to the
work so near her heart, and her great comfort was in
the thought that with Miss Buss’ oversight it must go
on successfully. On the occasion of a presentation to
Mrs. Grey of a beautiful casket, with an address from
the Girls’ Public Day-school Company, Miss Shirreff
writes thus to Miss Buss—</p>

<p class='c014'>“We are both of us touched to the heart’s core by your letter.
Such words from one who has herself been so brave and so
successful a pioneer in the cause of woman’s education are the
highest testimonial we could receive, and we value them as such.
And a large debt we owe to you also, for all the practical organizations
of our schools we learnt from you....</p>

<p class='c017'>“I may honestly say that the receipt of that address, and the
additional gratification of seeing yours and Miss Beale’s name
attached to it, gave my sister the only real pleasure she has felt
during the weary months of this year. The less she hopes ever to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>regain her power of work the more she values that testimony to the
worth of her past work.</p>

<p class='c017'>“We have had, of course, much passing enjoyment in the
beautiful scenery we have dwelt amongst, but there is a dark shadow
over all. It is not perhaps reasonable, when sixty is long passed,
to mourn that an active career is stopped short, but you know
better than any one how, in dealing with education, one must still
feel that no one worker can be spared—do we not know how all the
best are over-worked?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Ward gives us an interesting sketch of the
growth of the work from the first.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The aims of the society were mainly to provide for the professional
training of teachers above the elementary. This training
included both theoretical knowledge and practical skill. Unendowed
as the society was, it was necessary to create a guarantee
fund, and this was done by a few friends, while Miss Buss, sparing
no pains to induce teachers to avail themselves of the advantages
offered, contributed also from the first in money. At length, after
the tentative stage of providing lectures for teachers, the council of
the society were fortunate enough to secure from the Rev. Wm.
Rogers the use of some rooms in Skinner Street, Bishopsgate, which
served as a college for students, and leave for their students to
practise teaching in the large and interesting girls’ school which
now, thanks to the Dulwich Endowment Fund, lately available, is
handsomely housed in Spital Square, E. In 1878, however, when
the Training College opened, the school was in other and less
convenient buildings. These have now disappeared, to make way
for the Great Eastern Railway’s vast extension.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Miss Alice Lushington was, in 1878, appointed principal of the
college, and held the post till 1880, when Miss Agnes J. Ward became
principal. Miss Buss lost no opportunity of urging the development
of the work. She was indefatigable in her attendance at council
meetings, and eager to show her strong appreciation of professional
training by appointing as mistresses in her school those who had
gone through a course partly theoretical and partly practical.
Towards the end of 1880, owing to her strong feeling that the
society should possess its own practising school, the council
acquired the lease of No. 1, Fitzroy Square, and there, in January,
1881, under the headmistress-ship of Miss Lawford (now of the
Camden School for Girls), a day school was opened and named
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>after Mrs. Wm. Grey. In 1885, it became the chief practising
school of the society which in that year transferred the Training
College to Fitzroy Street from Bishopsgate. From that year, also,
the college was called “The Maria Grey Training College.” Miss
Buss was at that time desirous of affiliating the college to her
schools; but after mature consideration the council held that it
was better to pursue a more independent course, and wait until
they could establish their work on a permanent foundation. This
they accomplished in 1892, when their large College for Teachers,
Day School for Girls, and Kindergarten were all transferred to
Brondesbury, where they are finally located in a building which cost
£13,000. This sum was collected by the energy and devotion of
the council, and in this heavy task of collecting a fund for a work
the value of which only experts could be expected fully to appreciate,
Miss Buss took for years an active part. Her name on the council
was of signal use in certain directions, notably in the matter of the
Pfeiffer bequest. The sum of £4000 finally obtained by the college
from the trustees enabled the council to complete their building
and start their important work under Miss Alice Woods as principal.
The council thus provided for pupils from three years old upwards,
in surroundings at once adequate and suitable. Miss Buss’ strong
faith in the importance of the council’s work, to education at large,
her strenuous support in its early years of trial, her generous
recognition and appraisement of the efforts of the staff, were as
helpful as they were unflagging.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The feeling of the council at the great loss which
they sustained in the removal of one who had done
so much for the college, is given in the minute which
recorded that loss—</p>

<p class='c014'>“It was moved by the Rev. T. W. Sharpe, chairman, seconded
by J. G. Fitch, Esq., and carried unanimously: That the council
of the Maria Grey Training College, in tendering an expression
of their deepest sympathy with the family of the late Frances
Mary Buss, desire to place on record their sense of the irreparable
loss which the cause of education in general, and of women’s
education in particular, has sustained by her lamented death; the
council have also to deplore, on their own account, the loss of a
highly valued colleague, whose long and active co-operation in
their work of training women-teachers for secondary schools contributed
largely to the success already attained, and to whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>practical experience and wide-minded aims the council looked for
still further support in the future.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Nothing could show more distinctly the rapid growth
of interest among women in higher education than a
comparison of the help given to Mrs. Grey for the
Training College with that given to Miss Davies and
to Miss Buss for Girton and for the North London
Collegiate School. Only a single decade had elapsed.
In 1871, it was so hard to get even £10 donations, that
the gift of £1000 to Girton from Madame Bodichon and
from Miss E. A. Manning, and Miss Ewart’s £1000 for
the Camden School, shine out like beacon-lights. In
1881, for the Training College, we are dazzled by the
general blaze: Lady Farrer, Mrs. Pennington, and Mrs.
Winckworth give each £1000, and Miss Ewart and
Miss Soames each £500. Mr. Tomlinson also adds
£1000, which, with £4000 from the Emily Pfeiffer
Bequest, gives the college its start free from debt.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have no record of Miss Buss’ gifts, but there is no
doubt about her having done a fair share in this movement
so specially interesting to her. When the Maria
Grey College was safe, and pursuing its successful course,
a fresh departure was originated by Miss Buss. It was
hardly to be expected that graduates of Girton and
Newnham would come to London to be trained, and it
therefore seemed desirable to offer training at Cambridge.</p>

<p class='c006'>On April 6, 1885, Miss Buss writes to me—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am begging for help towards starting an experiment at
Cambridge for a class for training the Girton and Newnham
students as teachers before they enter their profession. They will
not go to Bishopsgate, but we (herself and Mrs. Bryant) think they
may be induced to stay in Cambridge for a time.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Cambridge is willing, and a suitable lady is ready. A house
for seven students can be had. Mrs. Bryant is to harangue the
Tripos students on the duty of fitting themselves for their work,
and I am promised help to the extent of £50, but we must raise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>£200, and Cambridge cannot do this. I think, if we can induce
the students to be trained, their fees will cover expenses, but we
must guarantee at least £100 to Miss Hughes, the mistress.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Will you (or can you, rather, with your other claims) help?
Can you tell me where to apply for more? I have these promises:
F. M. B. £10 (for three years), Miss Soames £10, Mrs. Bryant
£10, Mr. Brooke Lambert £5, Mr. T. W. Sharpe £5, Mrs. Micholls
£5, and Miss Behrens £5.”</p>

<p class='c005'>My name was added to this list, and I find another
letter dated April 1, 1891, when Miss Buss writes
again—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do you know any one who, for the sake of education, would
buy a house in Cambridge, and let it at once to the committee of
the Teachers’ Training College? It would be a safe investment,
and the committee could certainly pay four per cent. A splendid
opportunity of getting three adjoining and connected houses offers.
The college is successful, but the Cambridge people are poor, in
one sense, as they are given to plain living and high thinking rather
than to money making! Of course it would be easier if the three
houses, each at £1200, could be got, but the committee would
probably take one, and the others might be got by leaving a
mortgage on them.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I hardly think it right to take one myself, as I have No. 202
on me till the end of the year; and the leases of 87 and 89, in
King Henry’s Road, and the house 85 next door, and this will
probably be on my hands till the end of my life.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In October of the same year, she sent out a letter to
her friends bringing forward a scheme to secure a suitable
building by starting a company to raise the necessary
capital in £10 shares, to pay four per cent. She mentions
that she and Mrs. Bryant are ready to put down
their names for £750 between them, and asks for more
names, before the first meeting of the committee, with
an earnestness which could not be refused. In the end,
however, illness prevented further effort on her part,
and the work was done by others. Mrs. Bryant gives
some interesting details—</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>“My personal knowledge of her work in this field has to do
with the history of the Cambridge Training College. We were
much exercised in mind by the fact that the women educated at
the Universities persisted in neglecting professional training.
Either they despised it, or they could not afford it, or they did
not like it, and could get entrance into the schools without it.
Miss Buss, in her straightforward practical way, wondered that
they did not see their own need of it; she thought it so obvious
that a person undertaking a delicate task ought to learn as much
as possible about the ways in which it is and can be done. I also
wondered at the absence of desire in well-trained minds to get at
a theory of their art founded on a knowledge of its bottom sciences.
There, however, was the fact, and there was serious danger that
the credit of training as a practical success would be impaired by
the flow into the Training College of the less, and the avoidance
of it by the more educated women. Of course we could convert
and persuade the able North London girls, but these were only
a handful comparatively, and after three years at college they were
naturally not so docile to our ideas. Could anything be done to
avert this growing danger that the teaching profession should fall
into the two classes of those who were highly educated and not
trained, and of those who were trained but not highly educated.</p>

<p class='c017'>“We used to discuss the fact and its causes. <i>Vis inertia</i> certainly
had much to do with it. The Head-masters’ Conference had
passed resolutions in favour of training, but they had not raised a
finger to support the Training College intended to supply them
with masters. The head-mistresses, in larger numbers, believed,
but it was not always convenient to insist on training as a necessary
qualification in their intending mistresses. How was this inertia
to be overcome, unless an enthusiastic belief could be awakened
in the young intending teachers?</p>

<p class='c017'>“Such a belief was far from forthcoming. Indeed, our chief
stumbling-block lay in the distrust with which the ordinary
academic mind was apt to look on the ideal of training. At the
bottom of it lay, no doubt, a prejudice against the methods of the
elementary training colleges, and an unexamined fear that all
training must be more or less of that type. Otherwise it seemed to
be for the most part a vague distrust inarticulate, unargumentative,
but strong. On the other hand, there were leaders of thought in
the universities who believed that there was a great work to be
done in the development of educational theory and practice. In
witness of their faith, Cambridge had not only instituted a teachers’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>examination, but had established courses of lectures on teaching
which were at that time barely attended.</p>

<p class='c017'>“So the idea naturally shaped itself that training should be
carried out under University influences, that this would insure for it
the influence of the soundest theoretic ideas, and also that it might
benefit by subjection to the criticism of the academic mind. A closer
contact between the Training College and the Women’s Colleges at
Cambridge would tend certainly, we thought, to better understanding
and mutual adaptation. The practical thing, then, to be done was
to establish a Training College for Women at Cambridge.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Miss Clough, Mrs. Verrall, and Dr. James Ward were heartily
in favour of the establishment of such a college, and several other
Cambridge friends, including the present Bishop of Stepney, so
well known at Cambridge as Canon Browne, and Miss Welsh of
Girton, approved the proposal from the first. We held preliminary
consultations, Mrs. Verrall acting as secretary, while Miss Buss
representing the school-mistresses, and Dr. Ward the University,
formed a powerful combination of enthusiasm and conviction in
favour of the attempt. There were many difficulties; we were not
rich in money-bags, and everything depended on finding the right
person to act as principal. But there was a student at Newnham
who took the first place in the Moral Science Tripos, known to Miss
Clough as an able woman, to Miss Beale as a gifted teacher, and
to Dr. Ward as a talented pupil, and the matter was settled by the
acceptance of the principalship by Miss E. P. Hughes in June,
1885. In the September of that year, the college was opened in a
few small cottages near Newnham. A guarantee fund was formed,
and Miss Buss guaranteed £100. Students came, though of
University students but a few, and by the zealous economy and
good management of Miss Hughes the college paid its way. In
1887, it was moved into better houses in Queen Anne’s Terrace,
and this year it has at last, after ten years, moved into suitable
college buildings. Miss Buss never ceased to take the keenest
interest in its success, though of late years she was not able to take
an active part. It will always be a matter of deep regret to those
of us who knew how dear its progress was to her that she never
even saw the new building. From time to time she had hoped
to pay another visit to Cambridge when she was stronger in health.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Referring to ‘Miss Buss’ earliest attempts to start the training
college,’ Dr. Ward writes saying how he remembers the regularity
of her attendance at the earlier meetings of the committee, and
‘her anxiety to get Newnham and Girton interested.’ She brought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>the scheme for the college before the Head-mistress’ Association,
secured their interest and an arrangement by which a representative
on the college council was to be appointed by them. Miss
Conolly for several years was the representative.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Hughes adds some interesting memories of the
help given by Miss Buss and Miss Clough, as she says—</p>

<p class='c014'>“One of the most useful parts of my education at Cambridge
was the opportunity of talking over this educational experiment
with these pioneers. I shall never forget their patience under the
difficulties that were always springing up, their wise foresight to
prevent such difficulties, their earnest desire not to make unnecessary
enemies, and, at the same time, their persistent intention to
carry out the experiment. I remember the wonderful insight into
character which Miss Buss showed, and how quick she was to note
the strength and value of each additional member of the committee.
She had her own views, clear and definite, and for some of them
she was ready to fight; but she was quite reasonable and ready to
be persuaded that the special conditions of Cambridge required
special arrangements. When a beginning at last seemed possible
my heart so failed me that I felt unfit for the post, and had almost
decided not to apply for it. Miss Buss came from London to talk
it over, and I then realized how much her heart was set on the
scheme, and how much she had thought about it.... When we
began, Miss Buss came often to see us, keenly interested in all our
doings and in the many and great difficulties that tried even my
optimism. I should certainly have given up in despair but for her
help and advice....</p>

<p class='c017'>“I have found few persons, few women especially, who are
capable of seeing a subject in its right perspective, grasping its
fundamental points and being full of enthusiasm, but without
spending time and energy in elaborating its details. Miss Buss
had this unusual power to an unusual extent, and, in addition to
this, she had a strong interest in details when they were brought
before her notice. I was struck with the marked difference between
her treatment of work for which she was responsible and that in
which she was interested but not finally responsible. In her own
school she was not only interested in every detail, but felt herself
responsible for it. Sometimes, indeed, those who loved her wished
that she could have realized that her own strength and energy were
far more valuable to the school than were the details on which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>these were spent. On the other hand, I think one of the best
lessons she ever taught me was the vast importance of looking after
every detail one’s self. Her attitude towards our own college was
quite different; and, interested as she was in every detail, however
small, she always seemed to realize the two or three important
points which must never be lost sight of, and to be perfectly willing
to allow others to settle the detail. I mention this because it was
suggested to me when she helped to start this college that she was
so accustomed to be responsible for every detail in her own large
institution that she would probably wish to exercise the same
management in our college. Nothing could be further from the
truth, for she always knew the line beyond which help and suggestion
ceased to be real help....</p>

<p class='c017'>“The college, however poor in one sense, is rich in memories
of her interest in it. She made so many visits in early days, chatted
with the students, sent us books and pictures, and loved us and
believed in us with a love and faith which will go far to make us
what she hoped we might become!</p>

<p class='c017'>“What I owe to her personally I cannot put into words. Her
belief in me was a constant inspiration, and her love for me a
constant comfort. My life is infinitely richer because I have
known and loved her, and I am hoping to pay interest on the
heavy debt I owe her by holding out occasionally a helping hand
to other teachers.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I often think that we cannot yet realize the vast difference it
has made to our development of secondary education for girls that
our pioneers were large-hearted, unselfish women like Miss Buss,
Miss Clough, and Miss Davies. We are passing on to new times
and new difficulties, having lost many of the old leaders, but the
memory of their wise words and brave deeds is still with us, and
I do not think that English teachers will ever forget the life of
Frances Mary Buss.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Note.</span>—At the opening of the new buildings of the Cambridge
Teachers’ College, by the Marquis of Ripon, on October 19, 1895,
fullest recognition was given by all the speakers to Miss Buss’
share in the origination of this work. The ceremony began by the
planting of trees to the memory of Miss Buss and of Miss Clough,
by the Rev. S. Buss and Miss B. A. Clough; followed by the
“Hymn of Work,” which has for motto—</p>

<div class='c039'><span class='sc'>Longfellow.</span></div>
<p class='c015'>In spite of the heavy demands of her own special duties,
Miss Buss found time for much public work in which to
use her large experience.</p>
<p class='c006'>She always knew exactly what she was doing and
what she intended to do. In the expressive colloquialism,
she was “all there,” and she was always there. Whatever
she knew she knew well, putting it in its own
place, ready for use. The half-knowledge, with its consequent
mental vagueness, that contents most of us was
impossible to a mind so clear and strong.</p>

<p class='c006'>And she knew her own limitations, never professing
to go beyond. When we remember how wonderfully
vivid her imagination really was, we are surprised that
it could so be held in leash. In art she gave it free play;
and also in history—the story of human life which is
the subject of art—she could let herself go. We who
knew her in Rome could never question her power of
imagination.</p>

<p class='c006'>In Italy, she not only found but she used her wings.
Elsewhere, her imagination found fullest scope in
glorifying common things; in seeing through the
commonplace, thus consecrating common duties, and
calling out the best and highest in common persons—possibly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>a form of genius more rare than that which
can turn out fine verse or fine pictures.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here is a list of work which it overwhelms the
average mortal merely to contemplate. But wherever
she found herself she worked, and nothing that she
undertook to do was left undone.</p>

<p class='c014'>Miss Buss was a governor as well as founder of her own
schools.</p>

<p class='c017'>She was president and one of the founders of the Head-mistresses’
Association.</p>

<p class='c017'>She was on the council, and on three committees of the Teachers’
Guild, of which she was a founder.</p>

      <div class='line'>Governesses’ Benevolent Institution.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Foremost among later works must come the Teachers’
Guild, of which the first origin is due to Miss Buss. Like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>most things undertaken for or by women, it began on
the strictly practical or economic side; though it now
embraces the highest ideals of educational possibilities.
It is now devoted to securing the best conditions on
which the teacher can best grow; but the first start had
to deal with the question how the teacher might live
at all.</p>

<p class='c006'>And as we found the germ of all the higher education
for girls in the “Report of the Governesses’ Benevolent
Institution,” we find ourselves going back to that
Report for the origin of the Guild which aims at the
highest development of the teacher.</p>

<p class='c006'>Governesses, as a class, come to poverty and dependence
not from extravagance or self-indulgence, but from
sheer self-sacrifice, in unselfish devotion to the claims
of relatives, and to no class is thrift more difficult. The
effort to make it possible was from the first one of the
leading impulses of Miss Buss’ work. As early as 1866,
a letter from Dr. Hodgson shows that she had then
discussed the subject with him—</p>

<p class='c014'>... “You may remember the tenor of my remarks in Camden
Street on the ‘Reports of the Governesses’ Benevolent Institution.’
When I spoke of <i>saving for one’s self</i>, I wished merely to give, for
completeness’ sake, the other side of your phrase ‘saving <i>from our
friends</i>.’ The duty and advantage of saving are common to both
sexes. Individual cases might be dealt with, or judged, according
to circumstances; but the general doctrine must be preached without
reserve.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It would be much nearer my notion to say: ‘Earn sixpence
a day (if you cannot earn more), and save out of it a <i>penny</i>, or, if
that be not possible, then a <i>halfpenny</i>, or if that be not possible,
then a <i>farthing</i>. In any amount, however small, let the claims of
the future be recognized.... Let the general duty and wisdom
of saving be taught and recognized. Then let the needful allowances
be made in individual cases. It may be more meritorious,
because more difficult, for one person to save £5 than for another
to save £500. Let each judge himself as he would another.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>No subject was more constantly present to Miss
Buss’ mind, but no practical steps were taken till, on
December 2, 1881, the Women’s Education Union
appointed a special committee to consider the question
of establishing a Teachers’ Provident Association,
of which Miss Buss was a member, with Mr. G. C. T.
Bartley, Mr. Rowland Hamilton, and Mr. Shaen; Mrs.
Burbury acting as honorary secretary.</p>

<p class='c006'>In 1882, a plan was submitted to the Head-mistresses’
Association, of which Miss Buss thus writes to me—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Our Provident Association is not yet started, but I do not
despair. A lady is at work getting up figures, and if all is well in
October, we shall go at it again. By ‘we’ I mean the Association
of Head-mistresses. We want a sensational article for our Provident
movement. Will you write it? I mean, we want the fact
of death in the workhouse, misery known to the Ladies’ Guild, etc.,
brought out.”</p>

<p class='c005'>As member of one of the Relief Committees of the
Working Ladies’ Guild—a society founded by Lady
Mary Feilding for the help of distressed gentlewomen—I
had heard much of the sufferings of governesses, and
had discussed with Miss Buss the best ways of giving
relief. At her request, I now wrote a paper on “Thrift
for Teachers,” in which I suggested some co-operation
between the Ladies’ Guild and “<i>some possible Guild of
Teachers</i>.” This paper appeared in November, 1882, in
Miss L. M. Hubbard’s <i>Work and Leisure</i>, a magazine
containing the germ of many now important works.
In August, 1881, Miss Hubbard had published a paper
on “Co-operation among Governesses,” which was followed,
in December, by a meeting to consider the
scheme finally taking form as the “Women Teachers’
Self-Help Society”; with a Provident Fund and Free
Registry.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Hubbard suggested printing off some copies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>of my paper, which Miss Buss circulated among the
School-mistresses’ and Head-mistresses’ Associations;
but no immediate practical results followed, nor did
anything come of a consultation with Mr. Heller to
consider amalgamation with his Provident Association
of Elementary Teachers.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was not till December 1 that Miss Buss wrote—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I think something might come of the notion of the ‘Guild.’
The only thing is that it does not seem sufficiently definite and
practical.... We have secured the services of a very able
woman, Miss Beth Finlay, as lecturer on ‘Savings.’ She is ready
to take the matter up as soon as we shall have arrived at some
conclusion.”</p>

<p class='c005'>On February 7, 1883, a small preliminary meeting
was held in the Library of the North London Collegiate
School, of which Miss Buss writes on January 26—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I saw Miss Ward of the Training College on Wednesday,
and find that she is very anxious about a Provident Scheme. She
also thinks well of the Teachers’ Guild Movement. She suggests
that we should hold a very small meeting of a few earnest persons.
Will you be able to come, and suggest some names of those whom
you think we might ask?”</p>

<p class='c005'>The ladies present at this meeting were Miss Buss,
Miss Metcalfe, Miss Agnes J. Ward, Miss Dunlop, Miss
Hodge, Miss Rouquette, Miss Townsend, the Misses
Ridley. Some others were invited who were unable
to be present.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the minutes taken on this occasion, I find that
Miss Buss read a report which had been presented to the
Head-mistresses’ Association, and discussion followed on
each point of this report. It was finally agreed that the
Provident and the Aid Societies must be kept apart.</p>

<p class='c006'>The name was changed to that of “Teachers’ Provident
Guild.” A committee was formed of the persons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>then present, and Miss Jenny Rundell was proposed by
Miss Ward as honorary secretary, with the address of
the Training College, then in Skinner Street.</p>

<p class='c006'>On March 12, 1883, Miss Buss writes—</p>

<p class='c014'>“At a committee meeting of the Head-mistresses’ Association
held last Thursday it was resolved to establish a Teachers’ Guild,
the objects of which were to be—</p>

<p class='c017'>(1) To provide mutual help and sympathy.</p>

<p class='c017'>(2) To maintain a high standard of moral and mental education.</p>

<p class='c017'>(3) To encourage provision for sickness and old age, and to
found Homes of Rest and Associated Homes.</p>

<p class='c017'>(4) To assist teachers in obtaining situations.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This action was confirmed on March 16th, at a meeting
of the School-Mistresses’ Association, when Miss
Agnes J. Ward read her paper on the “Principles and
Practice of Thrift among Teachers.” At this meeting
a sub-committee was formed to establish the Teachers’
Guild.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Guild was definitely organized at the Conference
of Head-mistresses, held in June, 1883, at Croydon,
when Miss Hadland, Head-mistress of Milton Mount
College, offered her services as honorary secretary, if
the purposes of the Guild might be widened by the
omission of the word “Provident.” Miss Hadland also
secured the use of an office in the Memorial Hall, Farringdon
Street, lent by her friend the Rev. R. J. Verrall.
The clerical work was done at Milton Mount College,
with the assistance of the Rev. R. Guest.</p>

<p class='c006'>A provisional committee met fortnightly, working
out the constitution of the Guild, till, on February 23,
1884, the inaugural meeting was held in the rooms
of the Society of Arts, with the Right Hon. A. J.
Mundella in the chair, and with an attendance of the
leading educationalists, whose interest had been excited
in the new work.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>At this meeting, Mr. Storr stated that he—</p>

<p class='c014'>“thought it only right that the names should be given of the two
ladies to whom mainly this movement owes its initiative. One is
Miss Buss—not only the <i>doyenne</i> of head-mistresses, but the
mother of us all—I mean of us ‘Brethren of the Guild.’ To Miss
Buss’ energy all the earlier results are due before the accession of
Miss Hadland as honorary secretary, of whom it may be said that
without her unwearied labours during these eight months this
meeting could not have been held.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Hadland resigned her post as honorary secretary
to Mr. Jocelyn De Morgan, who was appointed secretary,
in the new rooms taken for the Guild at 1, Adam Street,
Adelphi. He was followed by Mr. Garrod, at 19,
Buckingham Street, and in the present office, 74, Gower
Street.</p>

<p class='c006'>With the appointment of Canon Percival as president
of the Guild, Miss Buss and Miss Hadland retired from
public view, but for some time they continued to exert
a very strong influence. Miss Buss was especially
active in the appointment of the secretaries, making full
inquiry before proposing the candidate, as she had very
high ideas of the qualifications for this office. The
value of the Guild in raising the professional aspect of
teaching soon became evident to her, and she omitted
nothing that could work to this end.</p>

<p class='c006'>The same feeling for struggling teachers that led to
the formation of the Teachers’ Guild moved Miss Buss
in the origination of the “Teachers’ Loan Society.”
The idea itself seems to come from Miss Beale, who
thus refers to it in a letter to Miss Buss, dated November
26, 1882—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have not yet had time to give the loan system a fair trial,
but I have no doubt of its success.... I think there should be
such a society attached to every large school, and a small number—say,
a triumvirate—should administer the funds. We have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>assisted five now.... I do hope something will be done to establish
some such system. It is so much better morally than gifts and
scholarships, as it makes the pupils think of their responsibilities.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Buss enlisted Miss Ewart’s interest in the
scheme, and a committee was formed consisting at first
of Miss Buss, Miss Ewart, Mrs. Stair-Douglas, Mrs.
Hertz, Mrs. Fitch, Mrs. Dockar-Drysdale, and myself.
Miss Ewart became honorary secretary, mainly supplying
the <i>loan-fund</i>, and to the present time has devoted
herself to this work, proving effectually that the
“amateur” can be thoroughly business-like, and that a
very large amount of most useful work can be done in
perfect silence, known only to those who have reaped
the benefit of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Every educational work seemed to enlist Miss Buss’
help, as we find that, from 1865, she was a frequent
visitor at the Working Women’s College, founded by
Miss Martin.</p>

<p class='c006'>As early as 1869, Dr. Hodgson gauged Miss Buss’
powers, and determined to use them in a sphere wider
than her own work. He wrote to her as follows—</p>

<div class='c024'>“<span class='sc'>My dear Miss Buss</span>,</div>
<p class='c025'>“I have a great favour to ask from you, though it affects
your own sex more than it does me. I wish your consent to be
nominated on the Council of Preceptors. The meetings, as you
will observe from the card enclosed, are only eight in the year, and
all these need not be attended. But no lady has ever yet been on
the council, and some of us are determined to break through the
barrier of custom which obstructs the doorway left open by the
constitution of the council. You will have a large and powerful
support, and success is almost certain, even at the first attempt.</p>

<p class='c017'>“This will be a battle worth fighting. I have written to every
member of the council whom I have thought at all accessible to
reason, and <i>every</i> answer is favourable. Now, I confidently reckon
on your <i>passive</i> support. You are not required either to labour,
or to wait, at least beyond the 11th inst., when the election will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>take place. Your consent is all that is needed, and I am sure, for
the sake of the principle involved, you will not withhold it.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“Dec. 16, 1869.</div>

<p class='c017'>“You would see from the papers that you were elected on the
council. Though you come <i>after</i> the three gentlemen on the list,
you came before them in the voting. You had fourteen votes, each
of them had only twelve.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In 1871, apropos to a deputation from the College
of Preceptors, Dr. Hodgson again writes—</p>

<div class='c024'>“<span class='sc'>My dear Miss Buss</span>,</div>
<p class='c025'>“I am very sorry that you are in such a chaos. I think
it extremely important that the claims of women to equality of
recognition in all education should be kept in view. They are too
apt to be forgotten by even those who are in principle favourable,
so inveterate is the <i>inequity</i>, <i>i.e.</i> iniquity, of English practice in
this respect. Your presence on the deputation will be a valuable
protest as regards both the existence of the claims themselves and
the fact of their being recognized by educational bodies. The nail
must be struck on the head again, and again, and again. Wonderful
has been the advance already made, but the battle is very far from
being already won.</p>
<p class='c026'>“Yours ever truly,</p>
<p class='c027'>“<span class='sc'>W. B. Hodgson</span>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In 1873, Miss Buss sent me a letter from Mr.
Christie, proposing to elect her a Life-governor of
University College, in which she adds—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Could you write to Mr. Christie in such a way as to answer
his question about my ‘services to education’?</p>

<p class='c017'>“I cannot well see my way to a fair estimate of my own work.
At all events, it is easier for some one else to estimate it for me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Her own letter to Mr. Christie may be given—</p>

<div class='c024'>“202, Camden Road, Dec. 5, 1873.</div>
<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Mr. Christie</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“I fully see the principle you desire to assert by proposing
me as a Life-governor of University College, and I shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>be very grateful, not only for the honour conferred on me, if I am
elected, but also for the great impetus which would be given to
women’s education, by such a recognition. University College has
been, of late years, so liberal to women that I trust the opposition
to such a course as you propose would be less than formerly.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I send you a pamphlet containing a sketch of the origin of
our two schools, but as we have made much progress since it was
written, and it is difficult for me to put a fair estimate on my own
share of the success, I have asked one of our lady trustees to give
you an estimate. I am sure you will shortly hear from her.</p>
<p class='c030'>“With many thanks,</p>
<p class='c031'>“Believe me,</p>
<p class='c026'>“<span class='sc'>Frances M. Buss</span>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>At the end of 1894, when Lord Reay “deplored the
loss of many distinguished members of the college,”
Miss Buss’ name appears in a very notable list, including
Lord Bowen, Lord Hannen, Sir Henry Layard, Professor
Henry Morley, Sir J. R. Seeley, and Professor
Romanes.</p>

<p class='c006'>In early days, the pressure of her own work, and in
later days, the state of her health, often prevented Miss
Buss from appearing in public. Here are two out of
many invitations declined with regret on this account—</p>

<div class='c024'>“Faversham, Sept. 24, 1871.</div>

<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Miss Buss</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“I begged Miss Ridley to tell you that I had not
ventured to express our very great wish that you might be present
at the Education Conference at Norwich, but I take courage now
to ask, if it is impossible for you to go, whether you would send
any written message or statement referring to any point you most
wish to draw attention to yourself. Miss Beale has sent us a most
excellent paper, giving her views on School Organization in the form
of an account of her college and its work. We hope there will be
an earnest discussion of educational topics, and if you would take
part in it by writing, if not in person, you would greatly enhance
the value of the conference. I do not know if Miss Ridley or Miss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>Gurney is going, but, <i>faute de mieux</i>, I need not say how glad I
should be to read any communication of yours.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I do not yet know on what day our conference is to be. It
will form part of the work of the Education Section of the congress.</p>
<p class='c030'>“Ever truly yours,</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Bryant, who represented her on this occasion,
speaks of the great regret felt by Miss Buss in declining
what would have been a crowning pleasure in her life.
She could, however, take a very real satisfaction in the
enjoyment of her substitute. Still more to be regretted
was her inability to take her place on the Second Royal
Commission of Inquiry into Secondary Education, a
place filled, in consequence, by Mrs. Bryant.</p>

<p class='c005'>This sub-committee received from the Royal Commission
£100 to send a representative to report on
American education, as shown at Chicago and elsewhere,
and appointed Miss Hughes of the Cambridge Training

Gilchrist Scholarships for the same sum, and eight with
Scholarships from the City Companies of fifty guineas
each. Among the latter was Miss Sara A. Burstall, an
old pupil and present member of the staff of the North
London Collegiate School for Girls.</p>

<p class='c006'>The work connected with this committee was very
pleasant to Miss Buss, and she was able to attend many
of the meetings. She was also able to be at the concluding
reception, when Mrs. Fawcett and Miss Gurney
entertained those who had taken part in it. This was
the last public occasion on which Miss Buss was
present, but Miss Gurney was struck with her enjoyment
and energy, in spite of her too-evident failure in
health.</p>

<p class='c006'>In medical education for women she was from the
first full of interest, as well as in the allied branch of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>trained nursing. There is some animated correspondence
with Mrs. Grey, in which the question of women medical
inspectors of the girls’ gymnasiums is discussed, Mrs.
Grey not seeing her way to it in the Company’s schools.
But, as soon as it was possible, Miss Buss had secured
this supervision, of so much value in the case of delicate
girls. Miss Julia Cock, M.D., now holds the post at first
occupied by Mrs. Hoggan, M.D.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Garrett-Anderson, M.D., was for several years
a member of the governing body of the North London
Collegiate Schools for Girls, elected as one of the representatives
of the Brewers’ Company. She pays affectionate
tribute to the memory of a friend of many years,
as she says—</p>

<p class='c014'>“There are very few people whose memory I would wish so
much to honour as I do Miss Buss’, and it is a real distress to me
not to be free to be present on Monday.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It is difficult to say how much all who care for the uplifting of
women owe to her, both as a pioneer and in her splendid work as a
school-mistress. I hope and believe that her name will long be
cherished and honoured.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Thorne, also among medical pioneers, speaks
strongly too—</p>

<p class='c014'>“She has been such a good friend to women that all will feel her
loss, more particularly those who had the privilege of her personal
friendship. From time to time, in the course of the past fifty years,
I have been in occasional contact with her, and, though so many
had far greater claims upon her interest than I, I always knew that
I could turn to her as a good friend if necessary. She was one of
the <i>earliest</i> supporters of the medical education of women, and
was one of the governors of the London School of Medicine for
Women.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The question of the employment of women was one
that touched Miss Buss more closely than any other,
since the needs of women was the very mainspring of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>her efforts in education. Any opening that would
attract the girls not fitted for teaching was sure of her
support. Here is a note, dated March 11, 1875, of
interest at the present date—</p>

<p class='c014'>“A new department is about to be created in the Post-office.
It is to consist entirely of ladies by birth and education, who will
have to pass an examination in (1) handwriting and orthography,
(2) English, (3) arithmetic, and (4) geography. Thirty ladies are
to be nominated as quickly as possible, out of whom <i>ten</i> will be
selected as first-class clerks, with a beginning salary of £80 per
annum.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Would this be of the least use to your friend? If so, there is
no time to be lost.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The placing of women on the School Board and
on Boards of Guardians enlisted most active co-operation
from Miss Buss from the earliest days of such
movements. In her busiest times she could always
arrange for a drawing-room meeting, and much canvassing
work was arranged at Myra Lodge, on the
occasion of the first School Board elections. Every
one who can remember those days will recall the
excitement and enthusiasm with which she greeted the
arrival of the post-card with the announcement—</p>

  </tr>
</table>
<p class='c005'>The elections of Miss Davies, Miss Chessar, Miss
Garrett, and Mrs. Maitland on the School Board, and
of Lady Lothian, Miss Andrews, and Miss Lidgett on
the St. Pancras Board of Guardians, were events that
made the “seventies” stirring times for women. And
in this stir Miss Buss came very much to the front. She
never could make a speech in public herself, but she was
the cause of many speeches that were made then and
since then.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>Like so many of the most thoughtful women-leaders,
Miss Buss placed the Suffrage Question in the forefront
of things likely to help the position and moral
power of women. She saw no discrepancy between
the possession of a vote and the development of the
domestic virtues; and she believed that the possession
of power would tend to make women worthy to use it,
in opposition to the other view that it may be well to
educate them for this use before giving it. We used
often to argue this matter, as I inclined to the latter
view, though I could not be blind to the utter absurdity
of refusing to such women as Frances Mary Buss the
power given to the most illiterate or debased peasant.</p>

<p class='c006'>In politics, Miss Buss was led by her heart, as most
women will be to the end of time, being the missing
factor that will, in the good days coming, redeem and
raise political life from its present depths. This woman
was inevitably on the side of Progress and Reform, and
being herself too wise to even imagine unwisdom, might
easily have been led too far where her sympathies were
touched; as, for example, on the Home Rule question,
into which she threw herself with all the ardour with
which in her youth she had followed the Anti-Slavery
movement in America, and, later in life, the War of
Italian Unity.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here is a little story told by one of her friends,
which is very characteristic—</p>

<p class='c014'>“She liked us for being in favour of Home Rule for Ireland.
One night, at Myra Lodge, she sounded me on my political views.
I tried to evade her questions, and said I feared my views would
be unpalatable to her (she looked, to my thinking, like a Tory).
When, after much pressure, I said, to show how bad I was, ‘Well,
Miss Buss, if you must know, then I approve of Home Rule!’ she
skipped over the room like a girl of seventeen, to Mrs. Bryant, and
said, in delighted tones, ‘Mrs. Bryant, Mr. —— is a Home Ruler!’
and brought her over to me. It was delightful to see her pleasure!”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>It was <i>not</i> delightful to refuse her that pleasure by
not responding sufficiently to her enthusiasm, much as
I, for one, would have liked to do so. But it made no
difference whether one quite said as she did, or not;
for she might have suggested those words of George
Eliot’s: “That seems to me very great and noble—the
power of respecting a feeling one does not share
or understand.” In all discussions it was hers “gently
to hear, kindly to judge.” For real tolerance it would
have been as difficult to match her as in the strength
and vigour with which she maintained her own ground.
That she was loyal to England if tender to Ireland her
words to her nephew show, when she says—</p>

<div class='c024'>“Sept. 24, 1891.</div>

<p class='c017'>“Are you coming with your choir to the Naval Exhibition?
Naval recruiting has gone up twenty per cent. since the opening of
this exhibition! I have paid a second visit, and am more than
ever proud and thankful to be an Englishwoman. We are, indeed—in
spite of our many sins—a great nation, the greatest on
earth.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Whilst firmly centred at home, her sympathies still
widened out to all the world. Miss E. A. Manning
writes on this point—</p>

<p class='c014'>“As illustrating the wide sympathies of Miss Buss outside her
effective and concentrated work, I am glad to have the opportunity
of referring to the friendly interest she showed in regard to the
visits to this country of students from India. To such as desired
to see the working of the North London Collegiate School she
gave warm welcome; and, whenever she was able, she attended
the <i>soirées</i> of the National Indian Association, entering with a most
kindly spirit into their object, that of promoting intercourse and
mutual knowledge between individuals of different races. Naturally
the progress of Indian women especially attracted her attention,
and she liked to take occasions of bringing it to the notice of her
pupils. In 1885 Miss Buss (with the permission of the governors
of the school) arranged for a meeting, in the Great Hall, of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>National Indian Association, where Mr. M. M. Bhownaggree,
C.I.E., read a comprehensive paper on the ‘Conditions and Prospects
of the Education of Indian Women,’ and we were afterwards
hospitably entertained by her in the gymnasium. At a later date
I gave an address at an ‘old pupils’ meeting’ upon ‘Home Life
and Customs in India.’</p>

<p class='c017'>“I may add that when Mr. Soubramanyam, of Madras, now a
very successful barrister, came to England, accompanied by his
wife (who was almost the first Indian lady to venture on such an
undertaking), Miss Buss made their acquaintance, and they have
always remembered her friendly attentions during their three years’
stay here. The fact that many of her pupils had taken up medical
and educational work in India, and had temporarily settled there,
tended to strengthen her interest in the conditions of life in that
country; but I was constantly struck by her full, free recognition
of all efforts for good, even though she had not time nor opportunity
to enter into the practical details of such efforts. Her sympathetic
encouragement, as well as her example, inspired many with hopefulness
and persistence.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She was greatly interested in the Peace Society,
and did much to promote the formation of a woman’s
auxiliary of that society, first suggested at a meeting
held on June 2, 1873, at the house of my father, when
Mrs. Julia Ward Howe, of Boston, spoke, with Professor
J. R. Seeley in the chair. My father had offered a
prize of £5 for the best essay written by Miss Buss’
pupils, and won by Miss Edith Kemp.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the following year, Miss Buss was at home, on
June 2, “to the friends of the Woman’s Peace Movement,”
and a paper was read by Miss Bennett, “On the
Best Way for Women to use their Influence to prevent
War.” A resolution was adopted to the effect that
“the meeting forms itself into a local committee in
connection with (or in support of) the Peace Society.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In reference to this meeting, Miss Buss has
written—</p>

<p class='c014'>“We certainly should form ourselves into a branch committee,
and local, as Mrs. Southey (the honorary secretary) lives on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>other side of the water. If many were formed, we might have a
grand meeting of all the branches, once a year, at St. James’ Hall.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I think it better to strengthen existing organizations than to
start new ones. I like your leaflet.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The meetings of the branch went on for several
years, and then, for want of support, it came to an end.</p>

<p class='c006'>Temperance was another subject in which she took
increasing interest, as it came more directly before her
in the work of the Rev. Septimus Buss and his energetic
wife, so well known in Shoreditch. Miss Buss
became practically an abstainer, and the subject was
brought before the old pupils on more than one occasion.
Miss Frances Willard received an enthusiastic
welcome at one of these meetings, and a note to her
shows the feeling of the head-mistress—</p>

<div class='c024'>“Myra Lodge, Jan., 1893.</div>
<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Miss Willard</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“As one of the many Englishwomen who have long
known and admired your great work in the United States, I send
you a hearty greeting.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I felt it a great privilege to be personally introduced to you,
and only regret that the necessity of rest during the holidays has
prevented me from attending some of the large meetings called to
do honour to you as a teacher and a leader in the great cause of
temperance.</p>
<p class='c026'>“Believe me,</p>
<p class='c027'>“Very faithfully yours,</p>
<p class='c035'>“<span class='sc'>Frances M. Buss</span>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>From the nature of her own work, Miss Buss was
unable to take any active part in the work of Mrs.
Josephine Butler, Miss Ellice Hopkins and others, for
the promotion of a higher standard of morals; but her
sympathy was with every wise effort in this direction,
and, in several instances, when her head disapproved
the means used, her heart went out to the sufferer from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>rash but well-meant endeavours. I can recall the
intense feeling with which she told me of the direct
action of the Queen in relation to a well-known case of
this kind. Of such sympathy Mrs. Percy Bunting
speaks warmly—</p>

<p class='c014'>“How much she has done in her life, and with how true and
loyal a spirit! She has always been so high in tone, and courageous,
and generous-hearted, and warm in friendship. She has always
lived a noble life, and we women owe her in particular a debt
of gratitude. She has taken a broad view of what was needed, and
has used her influence all along the line, as it were, for the welfare
of women.</p>

<p class='c017'>“And now she rests in God. Renewed and enlarged, she will
in some way realize what she hoped and prayed for here. I think
her example and influence have left a good harvest, as it is. As
women look back, they will always feel that she was one who
helped their cause in the days of its unpopularity. And she has
her reward.”</p>

<p class='c005'>All workers among the poor know her helpfulness,
and strong testimony comes especially from the clergy
of Holy Trinity. But the best must always remain
untold, as being associated with the deepest life of those
helped. In London, in the midst of her busy life, she
could not give much of personal effort or time to the
very poor, though she could and did give sympathy, as
well as substantial help, without stint. But at Boscombe
she could use her leisure as she pleased, and Miss
Edwards, who during her long residence with her knew
her life intimately, gives us a little glimpse of her
there—</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is largely owing to the fact that Miss Buss lived up to what
she taught, morally and spiritually, that she has been such a power
in so many hundreds of lives. She was so generous and kind-hearted,
always ready to help others to help themselves. At her
country cottage she would regularly send, and occasionally take
with her own hands, relief in various forms to those who needed it.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>A story of her consideration for her old cabman has
already been given, but a very recent sequel may be
added, as showing how Downes’ own feeling went on
after his death to his successor, who recently took the
opportunity, in recognizing an old “Myra girl,” to lead
up to a talk about Miss Buss, ending by his saying,
“They do say there’s as good fish in the sea as ever
came out of it, but we shall wait long enough for another
like <i>that</i>!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Also, at the funeral, an old pupil, who could not get
into the church for the press, heard one of the crowd
remark, “If all funerals were like this, every one could
not be buried!” To which a poor woman responded, “If
everybody was as good as that good woman, earth would
be heaven, and no one would need to be buried!”</p>

<p class='c006'>In addition to all that she did accomplish Miss Buss
had dreams that failed of realization for want of time
and strength. Here is one, of which we often talked,
though circumstances were too strong against our action
in the matter—</p>

<p class='c014'>“When you and I can have a talk, I want to suggest to you the
beginning, on a small scale, of an orphanage, like Miss Haddon’s.
You and J. might adopt it? I should want you to let me throw the
force of our school into it, making clothes, helping the outfits,
finding places, etc. Surely, too, we could find some volunteer
teachers among the old pupils? We might always notice it in our
magazine, too, and so make friends for it. I feel honestly that, at
present, <i>I</i> could not undertake the responsibility, though I would
help as much as I could.</p>

<p class='c017'>“What say you? Do not set it aside without thought. You
and your parents do so much already that it would only be concentrating
your efforts. A little house and a good matron are wanted.
I think my dear cousin would take an interest in it, and let the girls
have some training, as servants, in my house.”</p>

</div>
<p class='c014'>“The habit of viewing things cheerfully, and of thinking about life
hopefully, may be made to grow up in us, like any other habit.”</p>
<p class='c015'>Those who never saw Miss Buss in real holiday mood
could not be said to know her at all. As an educationalist
she was instructive, admirable, awe-inspiring;
but as a friend and companion attractive, captivating,
lovable. She talked “education” where she thought
her hearers were interested, and this subject always
interested herself. Also, she often went on little educational
missions of advice or instruction, and then poured
out of her full stores very freely. But such occasions
were not holidays. When she took holiday, she took it
thoroughly, and those who joined her holiday parties
all speak of them as Miss Hickey speaks of one which
we enjoyed together—</p>
<p class='c014'>“I had met Miss Buss before, but the first time I really knew
her was when we spent that Christmas at Clifton with her and you
and Mrs. Bryant and Miss Emma Elford and Mr. Frank Buss.
And since then I have even felt that no one could have truly
known her who had never been with her ‘out of school,’ and I
have been very glad to have then laid the foundation of a true
friendship with so great and noble a woman.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Most people know of her remarkable power as an organizer;
of her intense interest in her work; of her high conscientiousness;
of her openness to new ideas, and readiness to give a fair test to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>new methods; but few people are aware of the power she had of
throwing off the school-mistress, and of not only entering into
interests completely apart from educational ones, but of entering
into them with an unconsciousness of her position, and an ignoring
of what she had done.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This stay at Clifton was memorable to me in my
discovery of Miss Buss <i>as a housekeeper</i>. She managed
for all the party—indeed, I do not think any one of us
could possibly have ventured on arrangements or other
management while she was there to do it. Her readiness,
skill, and economy made a deep impression on us.</p>

<p class='c006'>On another occasion, years later, she came as our
guest to my sister and myself at Torquay. Up to
Christmas we had revelled in sunshine, driving every
day in an open carriage, and to this we invited her; also
choosing for her the room with the finest view. But she
came for a week of fog, such (so we were told) as Torquay
had never before known. We had one or two misty
drives, and the view was rarely visible. But she took it
as it came with placid sweetness, working, reading, or talking,
and was the least exacting guest we had ever known.
And, afterwards, she could only recall the fact of complete
restfulness, forgetting that there had been a fog.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here is a note by Miss Crane to the same effect—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Twice we all joined her summer holiday—once at La Bourboule,
and another time at Schlangenbad. I remember how she
used to enter into the pleasure and fun of our little afternoon teaparties,
given alternately by her party and ours, each vying with
the other in making the most of our limited paraphernalia. And
how she enjoyed the German custom of taking meals <i>al fresco</i> on
every possible occasion, in spite of gnats and other buzzing insects!
She was always quick to see and enter into fun, taking pains to
enlighten those whose perceptions were less keen. Her hearty
laugh filled one with joy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The same thing is given in greater detail by Miss
Bird, who says—</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>“I had known Miss Buss for years, and always felt attracted to
her, but I never knew her in her unreserved moods until that visit
to Kissingen, in 1882. We were all up in the morning betimes, and
used to meet on the Parade to drink the waters. There were some
wonderful bread-stalls, with an astonishing variety of fancy breads
and innocent cakes, where we bought bread for our breakfast, and
also laid in a stock for afternoon tea. We were a party of eight,
and we used to take turns in giving each other tea. When it came
to Miss Buss’ turn to entertain, she used to take pains to select her
cakes, that we all felt eclipsed. We called her ‘ostentatious,’ and
‘vulgar,’ and ‘low,’ and she rippled with merriment, and seemed to
enjoy being treated as an ordinary human being. She was taking
‘mud baths’—that look as formidable and ugly as they sound—a sort
of peat mixture that is supposed to draw from the body all its aches
and pains. I had seen in a window the picture of a woman
emerging from her ‘mud,’ and when Miss Buss was fractious, and
made excuses for not joining in the light frivolities of the place, I
used to say, ‘Well, if you refuse, I will post that picture to the
College to be exhibited, and the pupils will then see the degradation
of Miss Buss!’ This threat acted like magic, and, laughing
heartily, she used to comply. She grew bright and light-hearted,
and contributed her full share of amusing stories.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss E. P. Hughes records another of these times of
relaxation—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I spent a Christmas holiday with her at Cannes. She knew
that I had travelled little at that time, and she stopped at Avignon,
Nîmes, and Arles, to show me some of the old Roman antiquities.
Her energy and intense interest in everything was simply wonderful.
I had chiefly seen the educational side of her life before this, and
it was a revelation to me that she knew so much and cared so much
for other things. I am a fairly good traveller myself, and keen
about seeing new places, but I confess myself completely beaten
over and over again. I do not think that many people realize the
enormous amount of work she got through, so much of it being
unknown except to a few.... She was always ready to enjoy a
laugh. I can see her now, sitting in the great amphitheatre at
Nîmes, enjoying my discomfiture when I discovered that, through
my ignorance of South French <i>patois</i>, I had mistaken our guide’s
description of a Sunday bull-fight for a meeting of the Salvation
Army! At Arles I was severely bitten by the love of Roman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>antiquities, and while I was expressing this, in very Celtic fashion,
Miss Buss said she must take me to Rome some day, and laughingly
gave me permission to be as mad as I liked.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am glad to remember how happy she was at Cannes, how
keenly she noticed all the beauties of nature, how warmly she
enjoyed our delight in what was new to us, how sweetly gracious
she was to acquaintances in the hotel. I learnt then for the first
time to know what a wonderful power of description she had, as
she told me about her visits to Italy, and much about modern
Italian history, describing several eventful scenes witnessed by
herself. I can see the pictures vividly now which she painted in
words. I remember being surprised at the extent of her reading,
and then realized that she herself was so humble that, until one
knew her well, one was apt to underrate her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Buss’ intimates all fell into the habit of keeping
for her joke-book—a book from which she loved to read
on any possible occasion—any choice bit of wit or
humour, to reap double pleasure in so sharing it. She
had that strong sense of the ridiculous which so often
goes with the keenly sensitive temperament, and which
is so essential to perfect balance of character. Without
this quick perception of the incongruous there must be
a want of true perspective in life, with failure in the
right adjustment of the claims of self and of others.
Very great work can scarcely be done without this gift,
since of all others it most tends to complete sanity—to
the sound mind, if not to the sound body—without which
no greatest work is ever done. The intense temperament,
lacking this guiding sense, is almost certain to
show some warp or twist fatal to the finest achievement.</p>

<p class='c006'>To this most helpful power of turning from grave to
gay Miss Buss certainly owed much of her power of
sustained work. At the end of a term, she was able, as
she so often said, “to lock all her worries up in a drawer,
and leave them there.” She then gave herself up to
her holiday with all her strength, enjoying with keen
zest all new places and persons, and returning from her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>travels rested and refreshed. It is true that her notion
of rest differed not a little from that of average mortals,
who sometimes felt it something of a strain to keep pace
with energy so inexhaustible. She would beguile a long
railway journey with some stiff reading—very much of
her reading was done in railway carriages—and, on
reaching her destination, after a few hours’ sleep <i>en route</i>,
be quite fresh for a day’s sight-seeing, in which little
was left unseen that merited notice. She lived to the
full in the present moment, and thus made the most of
life, having learnt to leave the past behind her, and to
wait in hope for the future.</p>

<p class='c006'>Several members of the staff speak with the same
interest of the holiday parties, and of the value attached
by Miss Buss to the complete change of thought given
by foreign travel, quoting her frequent saying: “Do not
run in one groove!” as she exhorted her young teachers
“to save up for a trip abroad.”<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c018'><sup>[19]</sup></a> She planned and
arranged parties in France, Germany, and Italy, for her
teachers and their friends, where they might take
language lessons part of their time, and for the rest, go
on expeditions for “thorough” sight-seeing. And here,
Miss Elford adds—</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f19'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r19'>19</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Miss Hughes speaks to this point: “On two occasions I went with
her to see some famous Roman schools, as well as by her advice to Naples,
to see the wonderful school of Madame du Portugal. It was a great
pleasure to accompany her; she saw so much, cared so much, and compared
so admirably what she saw with other schools elsewhere, and she
was so careful to utilize what she saw and heard. She was always anxious
to help teachers to visit the schools of other countries, and did much to
stir in me a great interest in foreign education. I believe she first started
the idea of travelling scholarships for teachers, and she felt great interest
in the Gilchrist Scholarship when it was founded.”</p>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“Miss Buss was a delightful companion. I visited many places
in France, Switzerland, and Italy with her, and she knew the history
of every city and town. A stay of three weeks in the Maderanerthal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>will never be forgotten, as she was able to enter into all our expeditions.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The young always—men or women—were attracted by her
vivaciousness of manner and her delightful talk, so that our evenings
in the hotel were bright and cheerful, though no one knew who she
was till after her departure.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She always became quite naturally the centre of any
circle. I remember one day, when she and I were
staying at Ben Rhydding, we were in a corner of an
almost deserted reading-room, and she began to talk in
a low tone about the book she was reading. It was not
long before the nearest reader laid down his book and
came nearer, to find appreciative listeners to his good
stories of Ruskin—whose pupil he had been—and of
other notabilities, as he and Miss Buss exchanged many
an anecdote and <i>bon-mot</i> then crisp and new, though
since worn threadbare. There was no more reading
that morning, every one who came in being very willing
to join the laughing circle. Many interesting persons
came and went during our stay at Ben Rhydding, and
it was curious to note how soon they found her out, and
how eagerly all gathered round to join in the talks
which she set going. She enjoyed it, too, as she writes
of it to her sister—</p>

<p class='c014'>“The crowds of people who know me in London wear me out,
and I confess that in the holidays I do not want to make acquaintance
recklessly. In a house like this there is no end to them, and
I have literally no more time to myself than I get at home. Still,
the experience is pleasant, and worth having, especially for Frank.
Some day you must share it with me. It is a comfort to be without
household cares, and a place like this gives one plenty of opportunity
of studying life.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In summer she generally went abroad, and her
letters give very graphic accounts of her experiences.
There is a very full description of Fécamp, in particular,
most interesting, if space would allow. And also many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>peeps at German towns. Miss Crane tells how Miss
Buss stopped on her way from La Bourboule to collect
all the facts to be found in Orleans, for her lecture on
Joan of Arc, afterwards given to girls; and Mrs. Offord,
in speaking of the lecture, shows how, at that remote
date, Miss Buss anticipated the present cult of the
Maid, setting her in the place now accorded by a
repentant country.</p>

<p class='c006'>The entire change of life abroad made it very
pleasant to Miss Buss. From Berlin she writes, in 1882—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Our pleasant holiday is coming to an end! Like Sep, I seem
to revive when out of my own country. Yet I would not change
countries, if I could. Exchange climates? yes; but country? no,
no, a hundred times no! I like to be able to kill myself, if I
choose, by going across a road at my own will, instead of being
taken care of by watchful police and soldiers at every turn. It is
dreadful for a country to be over-governed, and that is the case with
all the German towns I have seen, so far. We got here last night
late; the Crown Prince and Princess were in our carriage (Frank
and I started with Sara Bernhardt on her wedding-night!). At
every point there are soldiers. The whole place bristles with the
detestable military spirit; horrible war-pictures are on the walls of
the galleries, and military trophies are everywhere.... I fear
Prussia will have to pay—like France—largely for her ‘glory.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>But a volume might be made from her letters in her
frequent journeys at home and abroad. She knew her
native land well, but wrote less about it. A few extracts
may be given, especially of a visit to Charlotte Brontë’s
home, during our stay at Ben Rhydding.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Buss had a very keen love of colour, and to
her the total absence of everything but dull drab in
Haworth was specially depressing. Houses, stone walls
instead of hedges, flat tombstones so thick that no blade
of grass could grow between them, all of this same lifeless
drab, give an effect of singular desolation. The
Parsonage, with its unbroken walls, in which were set
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>flat windows, and with its roof of slate, closely adjoins
the dreary churchyard. The only outlet for those
passionate young lives must have been in the blue of
the sky and in the changing tints of the expanse of
moorland stretching into the far distance.</p>

<p class='c006'>But it is of the church that Miss Buss has most to
say in her notes of the day—</p>

<div class='c024'>“August 18, 1879.</div>

<p class='c017'>“A party of seven started at eleven, in a waggonette, for
Haworth, a drive of eighteen miles through several villages and the
town of Keighley. Haworth (pronounced <i>Horth</i>) consists of one
long, straggling street, frightfully steep, so that one can neither
drive up nor down, but must walk.</p>

<p class='c017'>“We went to the Black Bull for lunch, and then visited the
church and churchyard. Oh, what an abomination the church is!
It is very old, dating from a <i>very</i> early period. It has only two
naves, and no chancel, nor transept, nor anything to break its
hideous straightness. Where the communion-table stands is a
window, small, and, on both sides, another window, very large.
High, worm-eaten, rotten pews, a deep gallery at one end, and on
one side, and broken or worm-eaten beams everywhere; narrow
seats, on which it is impossible to sit; no ventilation, the whole
place reeking with the accumulated foul air of centuries. Such is
Haworth Church!</p>

<p class='c017'>“Charlotte Brontë died twenty-five years ago—in 1855. In her
time the organ stood over the communion-table, and over the
rectory-pew! It seems impossible, but this is a fact. The successor
to Mr. Brontë has moved the organ into the side gallery, and has
taken away the pew, to leave room for some benches for the choir.
In this church Grimshaw, Wesley, and Whitfield preached.</p>

<p class='c017'>“We, of course, saw Charlotte Brontë’s wedding-register. We
wandered round the parsonage, which has been enlarged since the
time of the Brontës; we walked behind the house on the moors,
and entered the school where she and her sisters taught.</p>

<p class='c017'>“All the houses are built of stone, and look cold and grey.
Hundreds of English-speaking people visit the place yearly, through
the interest in the home of those remarkable women, the Brontës,
and yet the church is to be pulled down in three weeks’ time. It
seems a pity that no one can be found to build a new church, and
let the old one be preserved that we and our successors may see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>how and in what places our fathers worshipped.... Poor Charlotte
Brontë! After seeing the place, one understands how infinitely sad
life must have been in it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In striking contrast with this desolate scene was
another experience, when we spent a few very pleasant
days in the last home of George Eliot, at Witley, which
had been taken by our friend Mr. Neate. Miss Buss
writes to her cousin—</p>

<p class='c014'>“‘Daniel Deronda’ was written in her boudoir, now turned into
a spare bedroom, in which I slept. What a crowd of thoughts
come into one’s mind as one stands in that particular room. If
walls could speak!</p>

<p class='c017'>“The grounds are 3½ acres, so they are extensive enough to
afford variety. The house stands on the top of a hill, surrounded
by trees and shrubs. The sun is glorifying everything, and the
distant landscape reminds me of one of the lower valleys in Switzerland.
There are hills on hills, low, of course, in elevation, but
making the view very diversified.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Within a short distance lives Birket Foster, and nearer still
that charming water-colour painter, Mrs. Allingham.</p>

<p class='c017'>“But my mind is full of George Eliot, her books, her life, her
struggles, aspirations——</p>

<p class='c017'>“The carriage is here for a drive, so I have to conclude
abruptly.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Here is a letter telling of one of her summer trips—the
meeting alluded to being that first important interview
with the Endowed Schools Commission—</p>

<div class='c024'>“Harwich, Aug. 8, 1873.</div>
<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>My dear Alfred and Léonie</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“The sea is rolling in before my window; except for
that pleasant sound, nothing else can be heard! The sun is
shining on the opposite coast of the river Orwell, while on my
right stretches out the German Ocean.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Having leisure before service, and again, as I hope, <i>after</i> it,
what better can I do with it than write a little acknowledgment
of your loving letters....</p>

<p class='c017'>“I left home last Thursday, met Sep at Kelvedon, stayed there
till Saturday. The doctor, father, and I drove to Colchester, thence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>to Manningtree and <i>here</i>, where we are planted for a week. On
Monday I go by train (the father and uncle drive up, taking three
days), attend the meeting on Tuesday, and on Wednesday start for
Dover, Ostend, and Brussels, where Sep will meet us. Miss Jeanie
Ridley travels with us. On Saturday week Uncle Henry joins me
in Brussels, and we go on to Cologne, thence sleeping at Mayence,
and going next morning to Homburg, that I may, for the first and
last time, see the gambling-tables. They are to be closed this
year. At Heidelberg Miss J. Ridley leaves us, to remain with her
friends there, and we go on to Zurich, over the Splügen, returning
by Strasburg and Paris.</p>

<p class='c017'>“This route will take us to Venice by way of the Brenner Pass,
between Munich and Verona.</p>

<p class='c017'>“My dear love to you all. I hope our Charlie boy is having
some <i>riding</i>. A kiss to him and the girls from</p>
<p class='c026'>“Your loving <i>sister</i>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>At Heidelberg the party remained a few days, seeing
something of the country, through the kindness of my
sister’s friends, who lived in an old “schloss” outside
the town. During this journey my sister first became
really acquainted with Miss Buss, who wrote afterwards
to me—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I learned to care a good deal for your ‘child,’ and soon—well,
not too soon—found out how much lay beneath that excessive
reserve. Her <i>flashes</i> were very interesting to me, but my uncle’s
companionship made it impossible for us to fuse, as you and I did
in Edinburgh.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In later years, a course of waters at a German <i>bad</i>
became a necessity, and the letters give sketches of Spa,
Ems, Kreuznach, Carlsbad, etc., which may be summed
up, in brief, in extracts which also show the writer in
relation to her own people—</p>

<div class='c024'>“Kissingen, Aug. 20, 1885.</div>
<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>Mein theuerster, allerliebster Franz</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“Ich liebe dich noch und immer. It is difficult not to
drop into German; we have been in the midst of it so long, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>we take a German lesson so often at the little theatre. Besides, it
has such pretty expressions. The use of ‘thou’ to those with whom
you are very intimate is charming! It is a loss to have dropped
it in English.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Father will be home on Saturday, I hear, and I hope he will
go off to the ‘liebe mütterchen’ at Ilfracombe....</p>

<p class='c017'>“To-day, for the first time, we have rain. But we have been to
the Saliné, or salt springs, and are now going to the theatre. Last
night we went to a ‘diabolisch spiritisch’ performance by a conjurer.
The Duke of Cambridge sat very near us, so near that we
could hear nearly all he was saying.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“Marienbad, Aug. 16, 1886.</div>
<p class='c025'>“... At six a.m. a fine band strikes up a lovely <i>chorale</i>, which
wakes every one. Hundreds of people carrying tumblers go out
on the promenade, when the band plays, and walk about. There is
so great a crowd at the Kreuzbrunnen that they form three lines,
and walk slowly one after another till they get to the tap, at which
a girl is waiting to serve. Some, I among them, go to a hot-water
supply to mix with the icy mineral water, and then walk for twenty
minutes. After this interval, we again get into line for a second
glass, and have another walk. By this time the band has performed
five pieces, all good music and well played, and has gone
to the other end of the promenade, where there is another stream,
the <i>Ferdinand’s quelle</i>. I go here for a third tumbler and another
walk. I get nearly two hours, and then, but only then, go back to
breakfast, which all heartily enjoy.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I have a lovely room, on the first floor, beautifully furnished,
with two large windows looking out on the pine forest. Every
window in Marienbad has a large cushion, the size of the sill,
covered with white cotton. I find that these are to put your elbows
on to look out of the window.</p>

<p class='c017'>“To-day has been beautiful beyond description, cool and clear,
with cloudless sky, and the loveliest gleams of light between the
pines.</p>

<p class='c017'>“We leave here on the 31st, go to Munich for three days, and
stay to see the famous Gorge of Pfeffers, and then join Mrs.
Hodgson at Serneus, Prättigau, Switzerland.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I write a card every day to mother or father. Please send
this on. It is a great pleasure to me to have a card, dearest laddie,
and to know what you are doing.”</p>

<div class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>“Marienbad, Aug. 20, 1886.</div>
<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>My very dear Sep and Maria</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“... I wish Sep could get a chaplaincy in some
German spa, that would be so good for him and me, and that you
and Arthur could join me in a visit to the same place. The only
drawback is the long, wearisome journey. But one is repaid for the
fatigue by the delightful air and the complete change of surroundings.
One can live cheaply too. Our breakfasts cost—coffee, tea,
or chocolate, one egg, and as many little rolls as one likes—about
9<i>d.</i>; dinner, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> or 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; and supper, 10<i>d.</i> or 1<i>s.</i> Afternoon
tea we make in my room. I have the largest and handsomest
room in the house for 25<i>s.</i>, including everything. My room is the
general sitting-room, and where we receive visitors, of whom there
are rather more than I care for. The chaplain, Mr. Thomas, of
Jesus, Oxford, and his sister, with whom I stayed in June, are here,
with a fair number of English whom they know, and whom, consequently,
I know. There are four members of Parliament, Sir
Algernon Borthwick, Mr. Campbell Bannerman, Mr. Hoyle, a
most delightful man, and Dr. Cameron, M.P. for Glasgow.</p>

<p class='c017'>“After breakfast I return, and write or rest, while the others go
to the hills and sit all the morning among the pines, and sometimes
dine at one of the forest places.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I go to a hot mineral bath at eleven, and at one we dine. We
never know where we shall have our next meal, and very often have
little or no idea of what a particular dish we order may turn out.
So the life is so new and fresh, so delightful for a time that no one
can fail to enjoy it. The band plays, there is a theatre, there are
splendid concerts, two libraries, besides endless walks and views
in the woods. The air is scented by the pines, and by the wonderful
flowers. We could hardly be happier, in the quiet way that becomes
our age.... An Italian professor said to one of our ladies, who
was laughing, ‘Ah, I will tame you, <i>you screw</i>!’ She said,
‘What?’ He answered, ‘Why, you do not know your Shakspere!”...</p>

<p class='c017'>“The Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh only stayed one or two
nights, and had to go to the second floor. To-day we saw the
Grand Duke and Duchess walking about: they are very tall and
thin. Their children’s nurse is resplendent! She made me quite
wild to have her dress for the next costume dance!”...</p>

<p class='c005'>The greatest delights from travel came to Miss Buss
from the two extremes of North and South—extremes
which yet touch—Sweden and Italy, the two most
distinctively artistic lands. In the Venice of the North
she was at home, for she loved the people; and she
was not less at home in the Venice of the Adriatic,
where she loved the place and the associations. But
the City of the Seven Hills was the home of her heart,
and, without knowing what she was in Rome, one could
know only the half of her possibilities. Her first visit
to Rome in 1875 opened a new phase of being, and
gave her a way of escape from everyday worry. After
this first visit, she writes—</p>

<p class='c014'>“The worries, correspondence, and work of re-opening are
immense, but I am well, and resolute!</p>

<p class='c017'>“At Bologna, there is a marble medallion of Ugo Bassi, put
up by his fellow-citizens. I comfort myself, you see, by going back
to Italy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The visit to Sweden was something less of a holiday
than those to Italy, because it was full of educational
experience. At that date, 1871, Sweden stood in
advance of any European country on the introduction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>of the American system. Professor Siljiström, having
been sent to America to report on education, came home,
wrote his book, and, having a free hand, was able within
three years to work a complete reformation. Miss Buss
took an introduction to him from Mrs. Garth Wilkinson,
but he was unfortunately not within reach. Through
Miss Margaret Howitt, who had recently spent a year
with Frederika Bremer, she became acquainted with the
Baroness Adlersparre, one of the chief movers in educational
matters, and editress of a woman’s journal published
at Stockholm, a lady deeply interested in all
that interested Miss Buss, through whom the way was
opened in Copenhagen for similar experiences.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Buss intensely enjoyed her trip to Sweden and
Denmark, and after her return gave an account of her
experiences in two lectures to her girls, with clear summaries
of history, and vivid descriptions of scenery,
manners, and customs. The peripatetic (“goande,” or
“going,”) meals amused her, and she tells how—</p>

<p class='c014'>“there are no chairs round the dining-table, and no waiters.
Ladies as well as gentlemen help themselves, and the hostess has
little to do.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She also describes, in Stockholm, the novel custom
of <i>smörgös</i>, <i>i.e.</i> “eating a series of strange dishes as a
relish before the dinner began.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“On a small table, at the side, we found smoked reindeer flesh;
smoked salmon with poached eggs; fresh, raw, sliced salmon
(<i>gravlaks</i>); hard-boiled eggs; fried sausages; a kind of anchovy;
raw herrings, etc.; white and brown bread; brandy, etc. The
gentlemen drank one sort of spirit out of tiny glasses. Everything
was tastefully arranged on a snowy cloth.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But in this trip her chief interest was in her educational
experiences—of which she took full notes—varied
by pleasant social gatherings, to which she and her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>father and her uncle, Dr. Buss, were invited. In the
only letter that can now be found relating to this tour
she expresses herself very warmly—</p>

<div class='c024'>“Aug. 17, 1871.</div>

<p class='c017'>“We have been enjoying ourselves I can tell you! One of my
introductions has led to an acquaintance with a Miss Hierta, a
<i>Högral borna</i>, or nobly born lady, who is clever, handsome, rich,
benevolent, and young. Her father is the oldest member of what
we should call the House of Commons, but it is called the Lower
Chamber. He is familiarly known as ‘Lars Hierta,’ the representative
of the Liberal party, the friend of education and of women.
He is a fine old man of seventy-four, tall, handsome, and, I hear,
witty in the House, and always listened to with respect. He and
his daughter have been here to-night to ‘soppor,’ a word which
needs no translation.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Through Miss Hierta I have been able to see nine of the
great schools here. All I can say is that Sweden sets us a noble
example. Education is practically compulsory, as no child can
be confirmed till he can read, write, and cypher, and he cannot
get employment without the certificate of confirmation. Of course
such compulsion would not do in our country; but still it is something
to be able to boast that no child can remain ignorant of the
‘three R’s.’...</p>

<p class='c017'>“I feel that we English, who are so much richer than these
Swedes, are yet in many respects far behind. Here the State
considers that it is a duty to provide education for all. And all
this has been done, in the last few years, mainly through one man,
Professor Siljiström, who was sent to America, and who, on his
return, was allowed to remodel the school system (of which a full
account is given).”</p>

<p class='c005'>Nor was there less attraction on Miss Hierta’s side.
In the following year, she visited Miss Buss in London,
and, written in 1873, I have a letter speaking of her
sorrow in the illness of “our dear Miss Buss,” and she
adds—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I hope that she is recovered now; she is doing such a noble
work, and she has such a wonderful combination of greatness of
heart, of intelligence and energy, that a woman like this ought to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>live eternally even here on earth, where she is so much wanted.
How I wish we had one like her here to establish a model school
for young girls.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In Mary Howitt’s “Life” there is among her Roman
experiences an interesting account of a visit from
“charming Anna Hierta, a beautiful specimen of a
Swedish woman.” She was one of the girls deeply
influenced by Frederika Bremer’s “Hertha,” the book
that emancipated woman in Sweden, and seemed to
me to have in her all the splendid force of the fair,
strong women of the North.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first visit Miss Buss made to Rome was in
1875–76, with her brother, the Rev. Septimus Buss.
Here on a post-card are her first impressions—</p>

<div class='c024'>“51, Piazza de Spagna Roma,</div>
<p class='c017'>“Dec. 26, 1875.</p>
<p class='c025'>“We are having a delightful time; beyond all expression
enjoyable. To-morrow evening we visit Mr. and Mrs. Howitt,
and afterwards I will write to you. But we are out all day; have
a late dinner, and a crowded salon afterwards, so that I can find
no time for writing. We have had no rain, but the most marvellous
sunsets! Such as Turner only painted. This lovely city realizes
all my anticipations. In nothing have we been disappointed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And later, this letter—</p>

<div class='c024'>“51, Piazza de Spagna, Jan. 2, 1876.</div>
<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>My dear Carry</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“Rome is perfectly lovely! No word can describe it,
nor the thrilling emotions which it causes. Think of the overpowering
sensations I felt yesterday in driving along the Appian
Way by the place where Horatius murdered his sister because of
her grief for her lover Curiatius, and then under the magnificent
arch of Drusus, through several miles of tombs. We passed the
church of ‘Domine, quo vadis,’ the place where St. Peter, whose
heart failed him, and who was fleeing from Rome, met the Lord,
and in utter surprise fell on his knees, saying, ‘Domine, quo
vadis’ (Lord, whither goest Thou)? To which the risen Saviour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>answered, ‘I go to Rome, to be again crucified,’ whereon St. Peter,
regaining his courage, retraced his steps to Rome, and suffered
martyrdom. We then visited some ancient columbaria, or tombs,
containing ashes of the dead. Then we entered a great catacomb!
As I write, my whole body seems to quiver at the remembrance.
We walked about three quarters of a mile through the galleries
containing the burial places of many a holy martyr, especially of
the early bishops of Rome, most of whom gave their lives for their
faith. Nothing but coming here will enable a person to understand
this marvellous city!</p>
<p class='c026'>“Always your loving,</p>
<p class='c027'>“<span class='sc'>Arnie</span>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The year following Mrs. Septimus Buss was her
companion, and she writes to her brother—</p>

<div class='c024'>“Roma, Dec. 31, 1877.</div>
<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>Dear old Sep</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“Don’t you talk about letters! We have written to
you every day but one, and that represents a good deal when you
remember Roman habits. <i>We</i> are, however, always wanting news
of <i>you</i>.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Rome is, I think, more delightful than ever. Why is it?
The weather is not so fine as you and I had it last year, though
magnificent compared with English climate.</p>

<p class='c017'>“We hear all sorts of things. To-day I was told that, when
some cuttings for a new street near Cardinal Antonelli’s Villa were
being made, a skeleton, with a splendid crown on its head, was
found.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Before 1870 there were no schools for the poor. Now all Italy
has public schools, free, attended by many thousands of children.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The next year she writes to her sister—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Every place I go to is full of you. You and I are so fully in
sympathy in so many things—<i>here</i> especially—that it seemed almost
as if our hearts beat in unison last year. My present party is
delightful; they are pleasant, cultivated girls, and are very amiable.
There has not even been a jar. But surely I am not very difficult
for them to get on with?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not very difficult to get on with?” The answer
to that question is given clearly enough in a very few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>of the reminiscences of those happy days—Miss Findon
first—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I went away with her several times in the holidays, and in
1878 had the great privilege of being with her in Rome. Mrs.
Bryant was also there, and our party was more than a pleasant
one. Every day for a month we went about with Miss Buss, and
she seemed never tired of showing us the places she knew so well,
and pouring out to us her own stores of knowledge in history and
art, which made everything of double interest to us.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then comes Miss Lawford—</p>

<p class='c014'>“The time I, with some others, spent with Miss Buss in Rome
will ever remain a delightful memory. The many visits which she
had paid to Italy, together with her love of history, ancient and
modern, enabled us to get much out of our stay there in a comparatively
short time. We were in no danger of imagining we
knew the city, as she constantly impressed upon us that she was
merely introducing us to it! I can still hear her. ‘Ecco Roma!’
when we came within sight of the lights of the town on our arrival
there at night.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Bailey (Miss Emma Elford) writes at Christmas,
1894—</p>

<p class='c014'>“This time of year always carries me back to the happy month
I had the privilege of spending with her in Rome. How delightful
it was to know her in her private life, and how she entered into all
one’s little joys and sorrows. I shall never forget that delightful
Christmas holiday; each day now, as it passes, I almost know
where we were, though it is so long ago as 1877. Dear Miss Buss!
how good she was ever to me; never forgetting me in anything
that was going on.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Marian Elford echoes the same strain—</p>

<p class='c014'>“But to be in Rome with her was the climax of all delights.
She literally knew the history of every corner of it, both ancient
and modern. She was a good linguist, being able to converse
in Italian, German, and French. Not one word of ‘school’
passed between us from the time we left Holborn until we were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>back in our own places, for she had the happy faculty of leaving
work with all its worries behind.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In 1880, her party included my sister and Miss
Fawcett, who give still the same report. Of a visit to
Ostia, on this occasion, Miss Buss writes fully—</p>

<div class='c024'>“January 11, 1880.</div>

<p class='c017'>“We had a delightful day at Ostia. We went in a sort of
waggonette with a cover as roof, the sides open, four horses and
two men. Our start was made about a quarter after eight. You
know the road? Through the gate of St. Paolo by the great
Basilica, and then a turn to the right (to the left is the road to the
Tre Fontane) took us across ‘the dumb Campagna sea’ for miles.
The whole distance is sixteen miles. We stopped on the way to
look at the magnificent stone-pine forest at Castel-Fusano, a little
house belonging to the Chigi family. Then we returned to the
grand old Castle of Ostia, and, laying down our rugs, encamped
for dinner (or lunch) on the roadside. We had cold fowl, bread,
butter, cake, cheese, wine, and oranges. With our etnas, we also
made some cocoa. Fancy a perfectly delightful picnic on the 7th
of January!</p>

<p class='c017'>“Then we walked along the street of tombs under excavated
Ostia. To any one who has not seen Pompeii, it would give a good
notion of it. Some very fine statues have been dug up and put
in the Lateran. The excavations are going on slowly for want
of money. A fine temple has been cleared, facing the chief road
from this post. Ostia must have been as magnificent as the Via
Appia, in the days of St. Paul. You remember that lovely bust
of the young Augustus which was dug up in Ostia?”</p>

<p class='c005'>An interval followed after this till, in 1885, she
took her nephew Frank and a college friend of his. Of
this visit we have a full account by Miss Blatherwick,
which lets us into the secret of the comprehensive
knowledge of Rome which all recognized in Miss
Buss—</p>

<p class='c014'>“She had travelled all night, and arrived about 7 in the
morning. I quite expected she would have had her breakfast sent
up to her, and would have taken a few hours’ rest first; but no! <i>she</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>had seen Rome several times before, but the two gentlemen had
not; and as she could only stay three weeks, there was no time to
be lost. At 9 o’clock she appeared at the breakfast-table, looking
‘as fresh as a daisy,’ and just as though she had been there a
week. Directly after breakfast she said to me, ‘You will join us
in everything, will you not? We four will just fill a carriage.’ I
assented only too gladly, and that morning began one of the
happiest times I have ever had. Miss Buss brought with her
double or treble the number of books about Rome that most
people would care to take with them on so long a journey, and
generally she put two or three of them into the carriage, and could
turn to any passage she wanted to read aloud, although her own
knowledge was such that she was herself a ‘walking guide to
Rome.’ Her days there were passed much as follows: after
breakfast at 9, she went to her room for a little reading; at 10.30
we drove out to see and study something in the Eternal City; then
home to lunch, and, after a brief rest, went out again on the same
errand. At 4.30 we assembled in her room for afternoon tea, which
she and I had agreed to provide between us. We each boiled
some water over our little travelling spirit-lamps; she had brought
with her table-napkins and a dainty little tea-set; and then—all
being prepared—we gathered round the table, and had a delightful
half-hour. One day Miss Buss said to me, ‘Madame T. (our
hostess) does not at all approve of these afternoon teas; I think
we had better invite her to ours to-morrow.’ This was done, and
the following day Miss Buss remarked, ‘Madame T. said she did
not like afternoon teas, but I think she enjoyed hers very much
yesterday.’ Tea over, the gentlemen disappeared to prepare for
the late dinner, and Miss Buss quickly changed her dress, and
at 5.30 punctually she and they met in an unused back drawing-room,
and took an hour’s Italian conversational lesson. This daily
lesson ended when the dinner-bell rang at 6.30, and afterwards we
went up to the drawing-rooms, where all the visitors generally
gathered together, and games at cards, chess, draughts, etc., were
played. She always joined in some of them and in the conversation
till 10 p.m. Once or twice there was an excursion for the day
into the country, and one evening we went out to view the Colosseum
by moonlight. And this was her holiday!</p>

<p class='c017'>“I noticed that during this time, Miss Buss never once spoke
of her college, the teachers, or anything connected with business,
thus showing how wisely she could put care entirely aside for a
time, and give herself up to relaxation.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>Miss Buss always went to the <i>Pension Tellenbach</i>,
which, in her time, was quite a noted centre for the
English in Rome, the visitors’ book at the old house in
the Piazza di Spagna including the names of Dean
Stanley and Lady Augusta, Dean Plumptre, Mr. E. A.
Freeman, and, on one occasion, Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone.
Madame Tellenbach was a German lady whose social
position and knowledge of Rome gave her the power to
make things very pleasant for her guests, and she was
proud of the results of her skill and energy, a pride into
which Miss Buss could enter with a real sympathy. On
her death, Madame Tellenbach left her whole establishment
to her brother-in-law, on condition that it should
be still carried on, not being able to bear that the work
of years should fall to pieces, and not perceiving that
her bequest might be very much of a white elephant.
But, though not in need of it, Colonel Tellenbach
was not disposed to reject a valuable property, so he
and his charming wife established themselves in one
suite of apartments, and consoled themselves for the
sufferings entailed in the management by giving <i>soirées
musicales</i> and <i>dansantes</i> to their guests.</p>

<p class='c006'>That I should go to Rome with Miss Buss had been
our dream for years, during which my home claims
had never made it possible. At last, in 1889–90,
my sister and I met her at the Pension Tellenbach,
arriving there two days before her. The advent of so
scholastic a party would have carried consternation
into any British hotel or boarding-house. There was
Miss Buss herself, with all her weight of honours; there
was a governor of her schools and the honorary secretary
of her centre for the Cambridge Local Examination;
there was the head of the Cambridge Training College
for Teachers; there were two B.A.’s, head-mistresses, and
two Kindergarten head-mistresses, A.C.P. (Associates of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>the College of Preceptors). Even the girl of the party was
a Girton graduate. Fortunately, our kind German and
Italian friends had not yet learnt their alphabet in this
new style, and, in their happy ignorance, were conscious
only of the bright wave of fun and frolic, of clever and
wise talk, that filled the place with ripple and sparkle
during the next three weeks. After the day’s excursions,
amusing charades were acted by the English, with
artistic <i>tableaux vivants</i> in return by the Germans. The
B.A.’s gave a college party in their rooms, which were
<i>en suite</i>, and were charmingly decorated for the occasion,
where games were played and nonsense talked, to the
despair of Colonel Tellenbach and other gentlemen, who
were none of them invited, not even the Bishop himself,
who was head of the English table. And when they
had all gone, sad was the blank. My sister and I
stayed on, and, very often, in the evenings, did Colonel
Tellenbach come beside us to sigh over the loss of <i>ces
charmantes dames anglaises</i>!</p>

<p class='c006'>We had, of course, determined that our first sight
of the Colosseum should be by moonlight, so, that, on
the first brilliant night when all could go, we started—fourteen
ladies in a procession of five of the nice little
Roman victorias. None of the gentlemen were free to
act as protectors, so we made up in quantity for lack
of quality. It must be confessed that some of us could
have entered sympathetically into the feelings of the
rank-and-file of a forlorn hope. Malaria and brigands
seemed to us to lurk in every deep dark corner of the
vast ruin, and we did not know what might be the
perils of the way thither. But our leader had our
confidence, and we followed, to find the streets of
Rome as quiet as those of an English village, and in
the ruins nothing more than groups of tourists of all
nations.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>Still, our experience made us fully appreciate a story
which was going the round at the time. A solitary
Englishman, wandering in the ruins, was roused to
suspicion by the number of times he came across the
same burly, brown-frocked, cowled monk, who finally
jostled against him, turning suspicion into certainty.
The Englishman felt at once for his watch. It was
not there! He strode after the monk, overmatching
him in height if not in breadth, and, seizing him by the
throat, demanded his watch. A colloquy, unintelligible
on either side, ended in the monk giving up the watch;
and, with a parting shake that sent him sprawling, the
irate Englishman stalked off to tell his wife the tale.
“But your watch is on the dressing-table!” she said,
in alarm. He pulled out the watch in his pocket. <i>It
was not his own.</i> A veil falls over the scene. But the
early express next morning took away two passengers
who were not likely soon to re-visit the Eternal
City.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nothing marred our own complete enjoyment of the
scene as we sat for some time in the moonlight, opposite
the imperial seat, trying to bring back the past, to see
the cruel Roman crowd, to picture the stately Vestals
with their power of life and death. And most clearly
of all we seemed to see the Monk Telemachus as he
sprang into the arena, the last human sacrifice to Roman
lust of blood.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Findon tells of similar experience—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Once, as we sat in the Colosseum, Miss Buss read us Byron’s
lines and also Dickens’ words about it. I remember the tones of
her voice now as she ended:—‘God be thanked—a ruin!’ And
then paused while we tried to carry our minds back to that old
time when under that same blue sky, this ruin had been the scene
of those terrible fights of men and beasts, and the Roman ladies
looked on. How different from the tender heart of her who was
sitting in our midst!”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>Long before the story of Italian patriots was
generally known, Miss Buss had made it her own, and
she loved to tell it; as she had told us on the afternoon
of Christmas Day that year. I find a note dated 1877,
in which she mentions a talk with Old Pupils—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I told them about ‘new Italy,’ and read from Mrs. Browning,
and Mrs. Hamilton King’s ‘Disciples’ and ‘Aspromonte.’ Do you
know Mr. Browning’s ‘Court of the King,’ a small poem?”</p>

<p class='c005'>In a letter to her nephew, we find her feeling on this
side of Italian history—</p>

<div class='c024'>“Rome, January, 1884.</div>

<p class='c017'>“I hope you sympathize with the progress of humanity, dearest
lad, and with the regeneration of a nation! My heart thrills when
I think of how much men have suffered to make beautiful Italy a
geographical <i>fact</i>, instead of a mere name. Only last year a young
Triestine, named Overdank, was hanged by the Austrians because
he with others wanted to annex Trieste to Italy. Many people
think the whole eastern side of the Adriatic ought to belong to
Italy. Of course this was rebellion on the part of Overdank.
According to law, no doubt, he suffered. But the horror is that
the executioners are said to have sent the bill for the cost of the
execution to the heart-broken mother! She had to pay them, but
has since died—happily for her.... And those are <i>Christians</i>, and
have <i>mothers</i>!</p>

<p class='c017'>“Italy has a grand past. May she have as grand a future! In the
blood of the thousands of martyrs for the liberty and unity of their
country is the hope of future generations. Our country’s history
seems but of yesterday, when one is in Rome, surrounded by memorials
of the old Roman Empire. Have I told you of the discovery of
the house of Numa Pompilius, just excavated in the Forum, close
to the arch of Titus, under the old gate of the Palatine? It must
have been used by the Pontifex Maximus all through Roman
history to the time of Augustus, who chose to live on the Palatine,
and fulfilled the conditions by making his house on the Palatine
state property. When he left the house in the Forum, the Vestals
were placed in it, and the discoveries show that these ladies lived
in almost regal splendour in this house, and their statues, broken—in
some cases wilfully—and defaced, are being dug up daily. When
we came, one only had been found. Now there are from twelve to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>sixteen at least. On these statues is recorded the <i>name</i> of the
Vestal. On one the name is erased. Did she lapse, or did she
become a Christian?</p>

<p class='c017'>“In December last, a jar containing 864 Anglo-Saxon coins,
dating from 901 to 946 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> (I think) was found. How did these
coins come there? Surely they were brought by the Anglo-Saxon
pilgrims mentioned by Bede. Can you begin to understand the
extraordinary fascination of such a place?...</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am constantly in a state of thrilling emotion arising from the
associations, and one thing overpowers another. One was quite
speechless at the sight of the ancient inscriptions from the tombs
of the early Christians. It was a thrilling thing to see a man like
the Pope, whose office is so ancient and so sacred, even to those
Christians who do not agree with him.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It was really awe-striking to stand in rooms used by Augustus,
by Livia and by Drusus; in the case of the latter the frescoes are
as fresh as if done a few months since....</p>

<p class='c017'>“I wonder if I shall ever have the delight of introducing you to
the world of wonders concentrated in Rome?”</p>

<p class='c005'>My own memories of her in Rome are curiously
comprehensive of the whole range of interest in the
Eternal City: heathen, Christian, mediæval, artistic,
patriotic; in each and all of which she was equally
at home.</p>

<p class='c006'>On our first Sunday afternoon we had gone to the
Palatine, first pausing to try to imagine the splendour
of Nero’s Golden House, before we went on to stand
at the bar where St. Paul must have stood before the
Cæsar to whom he had made appeal. A portion of
the marble rail stands now as it stood then, and there
we tried to picture that memorable scene. Miss Buss
described to us how the heathen Court of Justice had
become the Christian Church, and so vivid was the
whole impression that to this moment I can still see
the graceful careless emperor, in the centre of the semicircle
of fawning, sneering courtiers, all making merry
at the claim to Roman citizenship of this mean Jew;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>with some pride too, no doubt, at the far sweep of the
Roman power to which her most distant subject could
appeal and not in vain.</p>

<p class='c006'>As we stood there, lost in the past, there came a
sudden clash and clang of all the church bells in Rome—once
there had been one for each day in the year—and
all the blue air was full of sound. Here was the
echo, still clear and strong, of the message of the
despised Christian, while of Nero’s Golden House there
is not a single trace.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, we are standing on the terrace in front of
St. Gregorio, and seem to watch the descending figure
of the monk Augustine—our Saint of Canterbury—as
he had just received the blessing of the Great Gregory,
and was departing on his mission to those fair-haired
Angles who are so like—and so unlike—the angels.
Then we turn into the refectory, where, day by day, the
saint entertained his twelve poor pilgrims, and we hear
how to his large charity was given the grace of entertaining
angels <i>not</i> “unawares,” since, on the face of one
of his guests whose special need had called out special
service, the faithful servant saw a light which showed
him that the Master of the Feast Himself was there in
very truth:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Who gives himself with his alms feeds three,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Himself, his hungry neighbour, and <i>Me</i>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>On another day we had gone to see the Moses of
Michael Angelo—earth’s most lasting symbol of the
imperishable Divine Law—and, as we came out of the
church, we paused to look at the picture made by
the convent with the tall palm-tree against the Frangipani
Tower, and heard how in time of famine the
Frangipani—the “bread-breakers”—earned their noble
name, as true <i>lords</i> (hláford, or “<i>loaf-ward</i>”) in sharp
contrast to the Borgias—the spoilers of the poor—whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>palace still stands to the right of the steps down
which we passed, going through the archway, that we
might look up to the balcony where the beautiful
Lucrezia must often have stood, to cool her throbbing
brow, under the quiet stars so high above all futile
ambition and fleeting passion.</p>

<p class='c006'>And yet another well-remembered walk, from the
Piazza di Spagna, past the studio of Canova, to the
Via di Ripetta, to look for the bust that marks the house
of Angelo Brunetti—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The tribune of the people, who could stay</div>
      <div class='line in1'>A tumult by the lifting of his hand,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And by the lifting of his voice could bring</div>
      <div class='line in1'>An array round him”—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>by his mother named Ciceruacchio, “Fair and strong.”</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And still the name grew with him as he grew</div>
      <div class='line in1'>To stature stateliest, and strongest arm,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And fairest face of all the City.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>And we talked of the great deeds of that fateful
year as we followed the street which is now called by
the name of him.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Who with deep eyes, silent and resolute,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Rode slowly up the steep of golden sand</div>
      <div class='line in1'>To San Pietro in Montorio.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Then, standing by the grave which tells of the
gratitude of <i>Italia Una</i>, we pictured the triumphant
procession up that same Via Garibaldi, as the ashes of
the patriots who had died for Italy were brought from far
and wide to rest in the Rome they had loved so well.</p>

<p class='c006'>My Roman Journal closes with a comment on Miss
Buss’ most able guidance, and the conclusion—</p>

<p class='c014'>“To be with her in Rome is something to be remembered.
She is always an inspiration, with her splendid vitality and energy;
but here, with her enthusiasm and her complete familiarity with
every association, she is wonderful indeed—a living flame of fire.”</p>

</div>
<p class='c014'>“And that which should accompany old age,
 As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends.”</p>
<p class='c015'>When we think of the vivid impressions of men and
things that we might have had from one who enjoyed
such varied experience, we cannot but regret that the
press and hurry of her life made a diary an impossibility
for Miss Buss.</p>
<p class='c006'>In the early years of her work she succeeded in
filling some small volumes, but when they were sought
after her death, nothing remained but a few pages with
notes of the childhood of her nephews and nieces.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the fairly continuous record in her Journal-letters
from 1870–79, and from Miss Fawcett’s Diary
during her residence at Myra (1868–88), as well as
from the letters to the Rev. Francis F. Buss (1884–88),
sufficient indications may be gathered to show us what
we have lost. From Miss Fawcett we get glimpses of
the variety and breadth of interests shared by Miss
Buss with the inmates of her house. Lectures on every
topic from the best lecturers, concerts, <i>soirées</i>, dances,
charades and <i>tableaux vivants</i>, excursions and picnics
to interesting places, interviews with celebrated persons,
all go to make the reader imagine what the interest of
a full record might have been. Life certainly must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>have been very far from dull in those days, however full
of work it may have been. And this was still more
true of the last ten years, to which we have so little
clue, when she went out even more among the leaders
of the educational movement.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here are a few notes that we should like expanded—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Miss Buss went to lunch at the Deanery, and afterwards had
a quiet drive with Lady Augusta Stanley.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“On Jubilee Day Miss Buss was invited to the Abbey by Dean
Bradley, and was seated next to Professor Max Müller. At night
she told us all about the ceremony. She had been intensely
interested in the greetings between the Queen and the Royal
Family, an emotional scene that went to her heart.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Miss Buss had an interview with the Crown Princess (the
Empress Frederick), and talked of education.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Miss Buss has been to the Prize-giving at the Richmond
School. She had a chat with the Princess Mary of Teck.”</p>

<p class='c005'>On another of these occasions she was photographed,
sitting beside the Duchess of Albany.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Hill notes a characteristic point—</p>

<p class='c014'>“She was never satisfied to enjoy anything by herself, and
living at Myra, as I did, I have been with her at different times to
all kinds of things, the Indian Soirées, the Bishop of London’s
garden-parties, the Royal Society’s Ladies’ Evenings, and big
soirées at West End houses in the season. In the same spirit, if
she had bouquets on Prize Day, etc., she would send them in old
days to Mrs. Laing, and, later on, to people who would care to
have them. If she had a carriage to make calls, she would take
some one for the drive.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then from her letters to her nephew at Cambridge—</p>

<div class='c024'>“April 16, 1884.</div>

<p class='c017'>“On Friday I lunched at St. Mark’s Vicarage, Surbiton, with
Archdeacon Burney, lineal descendant of the famous musical Dr.
Burney, friend of Johnson, Burke, Garrick, etc., and father of
Frances, author of ‘Evelina,’ and ‘Diary of Madame D’Arblay,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>the fashionable authoress of the day, on whom Macaulay afterwards
conferred immortality in his essay. Do you know her diary? It
is so minute that as one reads it one is transported into another age,
and moves among the great men and women of the 18th century.
I can never forget the delight with which I read it, in my twentieth
year, just as it was published.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Archdeacon Burney’s walls are covered with family portraits,
heirlooms, Sir Joshua’s well-known Dr. Burney, and Garrick;
Gainsborough’s portrait of Paul Sanday and his lady-love; of Dr.
Johnson, from the Thrale collection; of Madame D’Arblay (Fanny
Burney), and the next generation of Burneys by Romney and
Laurence.</p>

<p class='c017'>“And there are some lovely Turners, and also a fine collection
of autographs.... The visit was very interesting.... And then
there is an invalid daughter, with a most lovely face and spiritual
expression. She can only be moved from her couch to bed and
back, and yet is full of brightness and good works.</p>

<p class='c017'>“There has been a discussion lately as to the author of the lines
‘To love her was a liberal education,’ either by Steele or Congreve.
Well, to see the invalid Miss Burney is a Christian education!
How wonderful it is! Our heavenly Father seems to lift some
weak ones of earth into a supernatural strength that makes them
more powerful from their sick couch than the strong and healthy.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“Feb. 21, 1885.</div>

<p class='c017'>“I was in Cambridge yesterday ... it is not nearly so dear to
me as when I had a beloved boy there! But still it is always
delightful. Girton has been very gay—a ball, some theatricals
(the ‘Ladies’ Battle’), and last night the inter-collegiate debate on
Hero-worship; seventy Newnham girls were going to Girton, to
lead in favour. Girton was to oppose by pointing out how it
injured worshipped and worshipper.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I spent the morning at Newnham, called at King’s, to see Mr.
C. Ashbee’s new rooms; lunched at Girton, and had afternoon tea
there, and went to ‘Potts,’ to see Willie B. He asked O. Ashbee
to meet me.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“Feb. 15, 1885.</div>

<p class='c017'>“On Friday I went to a meeting at the Mansion House about
the Parkes Museum, and then to the Vicarage. Mother, who was
expecting Prof. Stuart, M.P., made me stay and dine with them.
He is very bright, and I liked him. Besides, he is a Cambridge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>man, and that is a passport to me. He told us some stories of
exam. mistakes, etc.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“Feb., 1885.</div>

<p class='c017'>“I have been out twice this week, once to Mrs. Dacre Craven’s
(<i>née</i> Florence Lees), wife of the Rector of St. George’s, Bloomsbury.
There were many interesting things to be seen, among others a
series of photographs of Mecca, also of Medina. They must have
been done by a Mahommedan, as it is death to a Christian to enter
these sacred places.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Another evening I went to the Countess D’Avigdor’s. She is
a most beautiful old lady. The ladies were flashing with diamonds,
and there was some splendid music. But most of the men were
Conservative, and were abusing Gladstone in a most shameful
way.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Did I tell you I met Mr. Guthrie (<i>vice versa</i> Guthrie)? He
is very simple and unaffected. I saw him at Mrs. Ashbee’s. Sir
Spencer Wells was also there, the famous doctor.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“June 6, 1886.</div>

<p class='c017'>“I go to Oxford on Friday, to stay till Tuesday, and a most
splendid programme of University sights, luncheons, dinners, meetings,
etc., is arranged for Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday. I am to
be the guest of Mr. Thomas and his sister; I think he is a Master
of Queen’s, but am not sure of the college. Friday and Saturday
I must give to the Head-mistresses’ meetings, but I shall see a
good deal of Oxford life. It will be grand to be in Oxford on
Whit-Sunday.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“June 29, 1890.</div>

<p class='c017'>“Every day this week is full of engagements, and I find it
difficult to escape them. I <i>like</i> to accept some. I should much
have liked to go to Mrs. Gladstone’s garden-party, and also to the
Duke of Westminster’s garden-party (I was asked as a subscriber
to the Church House), but I could not manage either, in consequence
of previous plans—Rugby, for instance.</p>

<p class='c017'>“For the first time, yesterday, I went to the Rugby Speech Day,
at the invitation of Dr. Percival, the Head-master. ‘Tom Brown’
was there, and when Dr. Percival announced him the cheers were
deafening. Mr. Hughes has aged since I last saw him. He has
made Rugby known to every civilized country, as well as live for
ever in the memory of Rugbeians.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Our own Prize Day was quite the best we have had for several
years. The Bishop of Rochester made an excellent speech, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>perfect taste, and Lady Elizabeth Biddulph, daughter to our early
friend, the late Countess of Hardwicke, also delivered a <i>good speech</i>,
which was liked by parents and girls. She is a thorough-going
Temperance speaker, accustomed to large audiences.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Cheltenham was another very attractive social centre.
There she met Mrs. Frances Owen, whose exquisite
lecture on Wordsworth, given at the North London
Collegiate School, introduced her to the circle there.
Mr. and Mrs. Middleton and their son were dear friends
of the same period, and Miss Buss delighted in telling
the stories of Mr. Middleton’s wonderful cat; especially
that of waking its master at early dawn one morning
that it might display five rats, laid in a row at the door;
or the still more strange story of its taking Mr. Middleton
into the library, after a fortnight’s absence, and there
telling him a long tale, which the maid explained by
saying that the cat, shut up in this room, had met in
fierce combat and slain another of the enemy.</p>

<p class='c006'>In Mr. Henry Middleton Miss Buss found artistic
sympathy, and also gave it, for her drawing-room was
one of the first decorated by Mr. Middleton in the new
fashion which superseded the old white and gold of the
first half of the century. I remember being taken by
Miss Buss to see Mrs. Middleton, “that saintly woman,”
as her friends called her, and bringing away a memory
of peace and joy. She had come to try London advice
for the complaint which proved fatal. And Mrs. Owen
did not long survive her.</p>

<p class='c006'>But Cheltenham, first and last, meant <i>Miss Beale</i>.
It is a joy to think of the meetings—happily frequent—between
these two kindred workers, who could give
each other so rare a sympathy. The North London
Collegiate and Camden Schools and the Cheltenham
Ladies’ College are two great creations, original works
of genius; and when we think of the continuous stream,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>scarcely less than a thousand persons, pupils and
teachers, always passing through both places, we find a
power and influence simply incalculable. The meeting
between the two heads suggests a <i>tête-à-tête</i> between
two queens, who for a brief bright respite may escape
from the loneliness of royalty.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c018'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f20'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r20'>20</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As an instance of the “true word spoken in jest,” we find this
separateness of the two leaders emphasized, at a very early period of their
career, in the often-quoted nonsense-rhyme, at which they laughed with
the rest—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Miss Buss and Miss Beale</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Cupid’s darts do not feel;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>They are not like us,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Miss Beale and Miss Buss!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The authorship of this quatrain is uncertain, being attributed either to
a master of Clifton, or to a boy of Cheltenham College. It is quite
certain that they were not written by one of Miss Buss’ pupils, nor were
they ever (as reported) found on the blackboard of any class-room in the
North London Collegiate School for Girls.</p>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Miss Beale was some years the younger, and in
fullest vigour when her friend was feeling the stress
and strain of work. But Miss Buss took the deepest
interest in all the later developments at Cheltenham,
and could rejoice in seeing at last the full realization of
her own early dream, in an institution where a child
may now enter the Kindergarten at the age of three—there
is a lovely school full of these happy mites—and,
after going through all the course, may finally leave the
Training School as B.A. or B.Sc., fully competent to
teach what she has so thoroughly learned.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was wonderful how many different interests were
packed into that full life. Besides all her private
visiting, and educational and philanthropic meetings,
there were the meetings of literary societies. She often
went to those of the Royal Institution, and of the Royal
Geographical, taking her girls. She belonged to the
Wordsworth Society, and I remember her keen delight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>in an address by James Russell Lowell, in the library
at Lambeth Palace, and again the satisfaction in the
beautiful simplicity with which Mr. Lowell, in an address
to the Browning Society, took the Christian side in the
discussions which were a marked feature of that society.
Even for the Society of Psychical Research she could
keep an open mind, though in general she did not care
for things abstract or vague. For fun she was always
ready, and I well remember how we enjoyed Mark
Twain’s subtle nonsense, in his lecture on “Our Fellow-savages
of the Sandwich Islands.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She had by nature and early association a great
love of the drama, and indulged occasionally in a visit
to the theatre, especially enjoying a French play, as she
says—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am taking an evening sometimes, however, to get a French
lesson at the Comèdie Française. I saw <i>L’Avare</i> last night. It
is most perfectly acted.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I saw Bernhardt in <i>Andromaque</i>. She is a wonderful actress,
with a curious power of impressing herself on the spectator’s mind.
Andromaque made one very sad; it seemed to point to the poor
empress. How thankful I should be to die if I were in her place.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She had much to say on her return from all such
experiences, as well as from dinners and <i>fêtes</i>, when she
had met and talked with eminent persons. Unhappily,
there was no phonograph to take down her talk. It has
gone, and with it all the record of times and seasons of
public and private import of which she knew.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then we have a peep at the books that interested
her—</p>

<div class='c024'>“Broadstairs, Aug. 26, 1873.</div>

<p class='c017'>“Frank has been my companion in all my wanderings. I have
<i>read</i> to my heart’s content; the laddie always goes to bed early,
and so I had always two or three hours at night. I have devoured
books on Education, Siljistrom’s American schools, Heppeau’s
ditto. So that I have had two studies of American education; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>one from a Swedish point of view, the other from a French. In
Belgium, my boy and I studied Motley’s ‘Rise of the Dutch
Republic,’ ‘Belfry of Bruges,’ etc. Although the holidays have
been more broken up than I care for—they have been restful and
enjoyable.</p>

<p class='c017'>“On Saturday 6th I am to go to Gunnersbury, where my
uncle Henry lives, and then I shall have a few days in the middle
of the last week of the holidays. <i>If I can</i>, I want to go to Stratford-on-Avon
on a pilgrimage—by the way, pilgrimages are all the
fashion now!—to Shakespeare’s country.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have been reading with intense interest the American book
on the education of girls—the answer, by an American woman, to
the book by Dr. Clark which formed the text for Dr. Maudsley’s
article in the <i>Fortnightly</i> for April against the Higher Education
of Women! The American women make out a strong case for
themselves....</p>

<p class='c017'>“If you have not read ‘Sister Dora’ let me lend it to you.
She is an encouragement and a warning! She was very self-willed,
and that is different from being strong-willed. She was the
latter, too.”</p>

<p class='c014'>(To her nephew, January 8, 1892.) “I am going to send you
two comic books—‘My Wife’s Politics’ and ‘Samantha among
the Brethren’—both books bearing on the woman-question—<i>the</i>
question of the end of the nineteenth century. You will perhaps
live to see the effects of the emancipation of women. Their higher
and fuller development, their greater knowledge, and therefore
greater sympathy, will bring them nearer to men of the best kind.
For the other kind of men—as Mrs. Poyser says, ‘There will
always be fools enough to match the men!’ I should like to
revisit our planet at the end of the twentieth century, to see the
effect on Society of the great revolution of the nineteenth—the
Woman’s Rights Question.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In early days, Miss Buss used at Easter to take a
large house by the sea, and fill it with her family—the
nephews and nieces bringing young friends—or with
pupils or members of the staff. Later, her country
house at Epping was open in this way for short holidays,
and of these Mrs. Hill says—</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>“It was delightful to be with Miss Buss at Epping. She
generally had something interesting to read to us in the evening.
She never minded what we did, and looked indulgently on all
kinds of pranks.</p>

<p class='c017'>“She remembered one’s likes and dislikes in the way of food.
One of the last times I had tea with her (in October, 1874) she had
some special cakes which she knew I liked, and when Mr. Hill and
I were staying with her at Overstrand, if we expressed a liking for
anything, she said to her companion, ‘Why do you not get it for
them?’</p>

<p class='c017'>“This minute thoughtfulness is a matter of constant comment.
Miss Edwards tells of a visit from an old pupil who brought her
daughter to Myra, and at tea-time Miss Buss asked, ‘Does your
little girl like sugar as much as you did, my dear?’”</p>

<p class='c005'>During her nephews’ college career she several
times took a house at Cambridge, always arranging
something in which her girl-undergraduates could join.
Of one of her dances there is an account from her friend
Mrs. Mathieson—</p>

<p class='c014'>“In January, 1886, Miss Buss called and asked me to join her
in giving a dance at Cambridge. Her two nephews were there,
and Mr. W. Buck. My son was also there, and my daughter at
Girton. I think we had about twenty from Girton, and the same
number from Newnham, and Miss Hughes brought about twelve
from the Training College. Miss Buss and I each took down a
party, and there were plenty of men from the various colleges.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I well remember the interest taken by Miss Buss in the
arrangements, and her distress because Girton and Newnham
would not extend the time for their students, who were obliged to
leave us at 10.30, which, of course, broke up our party, since we
were left with fifty men to ten girls, as Miss Hughes took hers
away when the other colleges went.”</p>

<p class='c005'>There is a little note from Miss Buss in reference to
this party, in which she says—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I find I have made a mistake in the date; February 25 <i>is</i> in
Lent. In any case, the dance cannot be managed before Easter.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Have you seen <i>Punch</i>? There is a small young lady who,
when accused by her mother of being ‘stupid,’ says, ‘No, I am
only inattentive!’ Let me hope my mistake was like the child’s!”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>Mrs. Hill, who knew the Cambridge life well, says
of it—</p>

<p class='c014'>“She seemed most in her element, so to say, when she was at
Cambridge. I went with her ten or twelve times, and she was
always most anxious that her young people should have the best
time possible. If necessary, she would herself chaperon us to
breakfast, lunch, tea, coffee, in the Undergraduate’s rooms, and
(what added to the pleasure) she enjoyed going. Twice she gave
a dance, when she made a delightful hostess.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It is also in reference to this phase of her life that
Mrs. Bryant gives this pretty picture of Miss Buss—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Her sympathy with young people was by no means limited
to the serious side of things, or to her own remembered experiences.
Her imagination, with the tender, happiness-loving heart behind,
held her in touch with all the innocent gaieties, and even vanities
of youth. Many will remember her pleasant parties at Cambridge,
including some dances, and the delightful way in which she acted
the part of motherly chaperon, never tired, never in a hurry to get
to the end, never distressed by those modifications in the order
and punctuality of meals which youth regards as a normal part of
merry-making. Respecting the vanities, I remember telling her on
one occasion that my niece was going to her first ‘grown-up’
dance. ‘There are such pretty shoes nowadays for girls,’ she
said, ‘I hope you have got her something very pretty. A girl’s
first dance comes only once.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Newman tells a similar tale of a time when, as
they were together at Matlock, Miss Buss asked her
to help choose some amber for a birthday present,
asking her opinion and advice. Miss Newman had no
idea that Miss Buss knew that the next day was her
birthday; but when the birthday came she found the
amber on her table, with a card of good wishes.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Bryant says also that—</p>

<p class='c014'>“when boys were in question, her sympathy was even more delightful.
In her family experience, boys had predominated, though
she had always been a girl-like girl, not given to participation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>in boys’ games. Her tolerance for boys, their muddy boots and
disturbing household ways, was quite unlimited, though doubtless,
and probably for that very reason, no boy of her circle would
have thought of disobeying her. I have spent more than one
happy holiday with her and her nephews in the country, and know
how to appreciate her rare sympathy with our more athletic ideas
of pleasure, and the ease with which her plans would fall in with
ours. Once I was with her in Killarney, and wanted to climb
Carn-Tual. ‘I want to go for a climb to-morrow,’ she said. ‘It
will suit me excellently to drive to the foot of your mountain, and
there will be plenty to amuse me while you go up.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>Her intensity of vital power kept her in touch with
all young life. The strong love of little children, which
was one of her most marked characteristics, was only
the lovely blossoming of this vigorous growth; nothing
refreshed her more, when she was tired of work, or worn
with worries, than to have a “baby-show” of her
nephews and nieces in their day, and then of their
children and the children of old pupils. She liked just
a few at a time, so that she might thoroughly enjoy
them, when she would herself get out toys from her
stores, watching the play while she and the mothers
told stories of child wit and wisdom. One of her very
latest pleasures in life was the visit of a little new
namesake—a tiny “Frances Mary,” who will rejoice
in the name though she can have no memory of the
kind face that brightened at the sight of her baby ways—and
one of her last quite coherent remarks was an
inquiry for “little curly-head,” as she called her nephew’s
little son.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here is a characteristic little story told by Mrs.
Pierson—</p>

<p class='c014'>“At the house of an old friend the other day I met a young
married lady with her baby. We were talking of Miss Buss, and
she said, ‘I only saw her once, when I was five years old, but
I have never forgotten her. She saved me from a cruel nurse who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>ran away from me, and hid in the coal-yards near Chalk Farm
Station, while I cried because I was lost. A lady came by and took
my hand and comforted me and asked me where I lived. “Near
some mountains—red mountains,” I said, and her quick perception
divined that I meant some new houses being built near Primrose
Hill. She took me in the direction of Oppidan’s Road, where I
soon recognized my home; and, after her interview with my
mother, I need not say the nurse had to leave.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>It is delightful to read Miss Buss’ holiday letters
about the children, who were often with their aunt
while their parents went for rest and change. While
the world was standing in awe of the “eminent educationalist”
she was inditing sweet letters full of babytalk,
of wise counsel hid in nonsense, or of the affection
of which her heart was so full—</p>

<div class='c024'>“1865.</div>

<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>My dear little Mother</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“Oh! what a boy is ours! to talk about ‘jolly’!
Naughty little monkey! We want a three-year old, not a grown-up

heart goes out to him twenty times a day at least. She pictures
to herself, over and over again, the sweet little shy face on the
pier, and her boy waiting to throw himself into her arms when she
lands.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I went last night to see Léonie, more especially to get a kiss
of Nina.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“Stockholm, August 30, 1871.</div>
<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>My dear little Mother</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“You do not deserve, by the way, to be the mother of
sons! You want sweet little goody children—girls—who will sit
still, and be made fine, always do what they are told (in public!),
never make a noise, and be clever, well-informed children, who will
answer any question (provided it be given in the form printed in
their books), write beautifully, and <i>spell</i> splendidly! Thank goodness!
‘<i>my</i>’ child is not one of those dear darling little humbugs.
Why, I am quite proud of his writing, and his spelling wants time,
of course. How many of Miss F.’s class spell better than he?
None, of course. Nor do Nina and May-May spell better. Their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>French bothers them. Frank is a sensible, well-informed lad for
his age, and, above all, he has a desire for knowledge. Education
is not reading and writing, but means a desire to acquire information.
As for Arthur, he is a darling; kiss him for his Arnie.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch-b3-04' class='c004'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <br /><span class='c013'>FRIENDSHIPS.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c014'>“A true friend is one that makes us do all we can; those who trust
us, educate us.”</p>
<p class='c015'>“To <i>have</i> friends one must <i>be</i> a friend,” was true of this
life on both sides. She <i>was</i> a friend, and she <i>had</i>
friends in abundance. Of her women-friends we have
had full proof, and we may count almost as many men
who mourn her loss with feeling scarcely less intense.
Many who are less known to fame will echo words
like these from some of the leaders in education. The
Bishop of Winchester writes of her as “one of the truest,
wisest, and ablest women it has ever been my privilege
to know and esteem as a friend.” Dr. W. G. Bell,
of Cambridge, adds, “Only those who had the privilege
of being called her friend realized how faithful she
was to her friendships, as well as loyal to the work
which was so dear to her.” Dr. Wormell, on hearing of
the fatal nature of her illness, speaks from a full heart—</p>
<p class='c014'>“The news you give me fills me with sadness. Miss Buss
gave me her helping hand and cheering smile when I had few
friends, and had scarcely crept from obscurity. It is not easy for
me to say what is the depth and length and breadth of my
affection for her—in all dimensions it is beyond measure. I grieve
as one who suffers irreparable loss, and can scarcely ask myself
what of others who have been closer to her?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>Dr. Hiron says that—</p>

<p class='c014'>“illness prevents the privilege of joining those who will gather
in large numbers to do her honour. But though not present in
person I shall be with them in spirit, and in the hearty desire
to give to her of the fullest appreciation of her personal qualities
and of her great services to the cause of education, particularly of
the higher education of women.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I first met her at Dr. Hodgson’s, nearly twenty-five years ago.
For many years I saw a great deal of her, especially at the time
when I was secretary of the Girls’ Public Day School Company.
From the first I was profoundly impressed by her insight into
educational problems, but, most of all, by her devotion, heart and
soul, to the work to which she had put her hand.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Storr speaks not only as an educationalist but
as a friend—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I mourn a very old and very true friend. I always felt with her
that, differ as we might—and we often differed on educational
politics—she was absolutely single-eyed, and her judgment was never
warped by personal ambition or <i>arrière pensée</i>. My girls, as you
know, were greatly attached to her, and I owe her much as having
set them the example of a noble-minded, generous, great-souled
woman.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Her influence over young men, the friends of her
nephews, or brothers of her pupils, was very remarkable,
and it would not be easy to count the number who can
add to the words of one of the college friends of the
Rev. Francis F. Buss—</p>

<p class='c014'>“To me your aunt’s friendship was a most valued privilege,
and I owe very much to her both on account of her personal
influence over me, and the many pleasant friendships she made
for me; and last, but not least, that she was one of the first people
to introduce me to ladies’ society at all.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Her letters to her nephew while at Cambridge quite
explain this influence. She was not in the least afraid
of young men, but was her own real true self always,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>thus touching the reality below their surface pretences.
Here is one of her grave letters—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am very deep in work, but I manage to find time for you, and
to think of you and your approaching ordination. You are about
to take the most serious step in your life, and I hope and pray that
it may be blessed to you and to those among whom you may have
to work during the rest of your life. It is a noble profession, but
one that entails much self-control and self-sacrifice. But if you
think chiefly of the work to which you are called, and not of
yourself, you will be useful and happy. You must not think too
much about what people may say or think of you, but simply do
your work faithfully and leave the results. You are disposed to
mind ‘Mrs. Grundy’ too much, my very dear boy, but this is not
a good thing if carried to excess. To be careful in imagination, to
put one’s self into the place of another, is right, but this is the
opposite of minding ‘Mrs. Grundy.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>These letters are full of wisdom as well as of tender
thoughtfulness. She wanted him to profit to the full
by the advantages which she esteemed so highly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“At Cambridge, more than anywhere else,” she says (for the
moment forgetting Oxford), “is to be found the highest product, so
far, of human civilization. Men there get the highest culture ever
yet attained, and the ‘Dons’ are also the most finished gentlemen.
There is an indescribable something in the bearing, air, tone of
voice even, of a Cambridge man which I believe he never loses all
his life. But the men are most courteous towards women: that is
one distinct mark of their training. I have never heard a rough
word nor seen a rough act towards women, and I want you to
become such a man as the best men in your University.”</p>

<p class='c005'>At the same time she is interested in the smallest
details of the new life, as when she writes—</p>

<p class='c014'>“It was a great delight to me to see you in your rooms. But the
sofa is rather shabby. Shall I send you an Afghan rug to throw over
it? Tell me. Perhaps you would rather choose one for yourself?”</p>

<p class='c005'>But of all the friends of whom she thought and for
whom she cared time would fail to tell. Her sky was
full of “bright particular stars,” each moving in its own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>orbit. Perhaps her regard may have been most fixed
by the “double-stars,” of which there were many
brilliant examples. Her “dual friendships” seemed
to have doubled strength and joy for her. It was
either that her friends married to please her as well
as each other, or that she could at the same time
include divergent characters; but all her life she was
singularly happy in her married friends.</p>

<p class='c006'>Her ideal of family life was high, as we see from
an interesting letter written from Bonaly in September,
1877—</p>

<p class='c014'>“As I travelled here, on Tuesday, by way of Kendal and
Carlisle, my mind was full of you. You remember our journey
together to Edinburgh? I left Salisbury, on Monday, in a dreadful
storm of rain. It is much colder here. Along the road, it was
quite sorrowful to see the sheaves of corn standing in water!
Whole fields, too, are lying under water.</p>

<p class='c017'>“During my railway journey here, and one last Saturday to
Cheltenham, I read ‘Kingsley’s Life.’ It is intensely interesting,
and is to me like a strong tonic. It braces one up and leaves
strength behind. How he suffered in middle life, and how bravely
he bore up, under undeserved blame, is all told, and how loving,
tender, and faithful he was as a husband.</p>

<p class='c017'>“His married life is a beautiful poem. Mrs. Kingsley was
everything to him. For her sake, he revered all womanhood. One
of his children speaks of the happy evenings at Eversley Rectory
when ‘father sat with his hand in mother’s,’ and poured out his
brave, strong words for wife and children only.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I esteem it one of the proud moments in my life, when Canon
Kingsley thought it worth while to stand and talk with Miss Chessar
and me about our school, and expressed his wish to visit us—a
wish never fulfilled. His life is so much more after my heart than
Harriet Martineau’s, which I have also been looking at. Her
strictures on men and women are so harsh—there was little love
and tenderness in her nature, and she seems always to say hard
things—things which leave a sting behind. I shudder at her
absence of all belief, and wonder how she could bear life after
ceasing to believe in a personal God and immortality. Kingsley’s
life is an antidote to hers.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>In early days Mr. and Mrs. Laing held equal rank
in her regard. Then her brothers—her <i>friends</i> as well
as kin—gave her dear friends as well as loved sisters
in their wives. Here is a pretty little note which was
written on their wedding-day to Mr. and Mrs. Septimus
Buss, addressed to “Dear old boy—Dear little ‘coz.’”
After describing the later events of the wedding-day,
she says of the wife of the vicar—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mrs. N. is a dear! She said she was much interested in
your wedding, as she had a hand in it, and liked old Sep, and she
spoke so nicely about him in particular, and things in general, that
I fell in love with her; and then, to complete her victory, she
admired Léonie, my dear ‘old’ sister. Now, did she not go the
right way to win me for ever?”</p>

<p class='c005'>She had not lost this sprightly style in writing, in
1873, of the change which took the Rev. Septimus Buss
from the chaplaincy of St. Pancras Workhouse to the
Rectory of Wapping—</p>

<p class='c014'>“‘Many a time and oft’ have I thought of you and wished to be
a bird, that I might fly to you. But even you cannot guess what
the last fortnight has been!</p>

<p class='c017'>“I was dictating this morning ‘du déplorable sort des choses
humaines, qui veut qu’au succès social soient toujours mêlées des
disgrâces, et que nos joies soient toujours accompagnées de
tristesses.’</p>

<p class='c017'>“My dear boy Sep has a living offered him by the bishop—at
last! The great desire of my heart (outside the work—well, no!—inside
everything) has been to see him out of the workhouse!
Well, he is to go to Wapping.... How true it is that nothing is
simple and single....”</p>

<p class='c005'>In 1881 she writes to the Rev. Septimus Buss on
his transference to the Vicarage of Shoreditch—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am so thankful to know of your promotion. You both
deserve it, for you are model parish chiefs. Shoreditch must be
very poor, judging from the little one sees in passing through it—only
I suppose it is not damp. Dear little mother, I hope you will
like the place. Anyhow, it is better than Wapping.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>Of another dual friendship we have a charming
glimpse in a note to Dr. J. G. Fitch, in response to the
gift of his first book—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Since seeing you, I have looked at the dedication, and am
much touched by it.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It is a great privilege and happiness to know such a home
as yours.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Lately, I have been talking to my young people about women’s
duties, and I quoted Mills’ dedication to ‘Liberty,’ De Toqueville’s
tribute to his wife, and others. Yours is but another example of
the wife’s ‘work and counsel’ which enables a man to do and
‘write things useful.’</p>

<p class='c017'>“I thank you most warmly for the book itself, for the kind
words with which it was accompanied, and I also thank you for
the dedication, because, through the ‘dearest wife,’ it is a tribute
to all women.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Also in the home of Dr. and Mrs. Hodgson, she
found full scope for the strong element of romance
which never died out of her nature. Some part of her
holiday was always spent with them, and she expanded
to the full in these congenial surroundings. They
lived for a time in London; then at Bournemouth,
where Mrs. Hodgson went to be near her father, Sir
Joshua Walmsley; and finally at Bonaly, when Dr.
Hodgson filled the Chair of Economic Science in
Edinburgh, each home being more charming than
the last.</p>

<p class='c006'>She first writes of these visits to me in 1872—</p>

<p class='c014'>“My Bournemouth visit has been most pleasant, as indeed my
visits to Mrs. Hodgson always are. She is one of the most lovable,
loving, and unselfish women I know, and her home-life is a
constant lesson. She is one of those whom I dearly love, and who
are necessary to me. Yet, seven years ago, I did not know her.
Her father’s illness and death have tried her much lately, and
Dr. Hodgson’s absence in Edinburgh throws much responsibility
on her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In 1858, Dr. Hodgson was Assistant-Commissioner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>on the First Royal Commission of Inquiry into Primary
Education, and he probably became interested in Miss
Buss in connection with her evidence before the
Secondary Commission, in 1865. After that date, he
gave his lectures on Physiology and Political Economy
in her school, and acquaintance ripened into friendship.
Three thick note-books, in her own writing, testify to
her interest in the lectures, as well as to her indomitable
energy and industry.</p>

<p class='c006'>In 1873, she says—</p>

<p class='c014'>“The temptation to go to Bradford is immense. My dear
friend, Dr. Hodgson, who has done more for me intellectually than
any man, except Mr. Laing, in my whole life, is president! But
to go from Friday to Monday would hardly be of any use, would
it? And I could not be absent a week. Can we find out <i>when</i>
the papers are read?</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am so driven! It is really dreadful, and I feel so weary
that I can hardly bear myself. But when the machine is once
wound up and set going, I get better.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I fear that Bradford meeting will clash with our Board
meeting. October 8th, is it not? Our meeting will be very important,
and I must have <i>hours</i> of leisure to compare the schemes
and annotate them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>During Dr. Hodgson’s residence in London, before
going to Bournemouth, his house was full of interest to
Miss Buss, taking the same place in her life as Mr.
Laing’s had done as a meeting-point for persons with
whom she was in sympathy. Dr. Hiron mentions one
eventful dinner-party, which began the friendship between
Mr. and Mrs. Fitch and Miss Buss, as well as
with himself.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are a few words to her sister, which show the
influence of Dr. Hodgson from 1865, and onwards—</p>

<div class='c024'>“1865.</div>

<p class='c017'>“Miss Davies has asked me to meet Miss Clough of Ambleside
(who drew up a plan for co-operation among teachers), Miss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>Bostock, and other educational ladies. I cannot help feeling that
our new friend, to whom I am so devoted and grateful, has had
greatly to do with my position lately. It is almost indefinable, but
it would seem as if he had set a stamp on me, so to speak. Certainly
the Cambridge Examination did something—introduced me
to him, for example—but it is only since Christmas that so many
little courtesies have been paid me, officially, I mean. Only one
other person so helped me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In some early letters we have descriptions of life at
Bonaly Tower, which indicate the kind of letters she
might have written if life had been less hurried—</p>

<div class='c024'>“Newcastle-on-Tyne, Jan. 7, 1873.</div>

<p class='c017'>“I liked Mr. Knox quite as much last Wednesday. He gave
me a hearty welcome, and asked most affectionately for you.
From what Dr. Hodgson says, he is not doing so much on the
Merchants’ Company Schools as he was. I lunched at Mr.
Pryde’s house, and then went with him and Mrs. Pryde to the
‘Women’s Medical Educational Meeting.’ For the first time I
heard Miss Jex-Blake speak; she spoke well. Mr. P. seems
sensible and liberal in his ideas. When you and I were in
Edinburgh, it seems Mrs. P. and two of their children had scarlet
fever, and he himself was in lodgings, away from ‘his own fireside.’
Mrs. P. is quite ‘advanced,’ and, as her husband said, ‘is the most
refractory parent’ he has to do with. ‘She was always wanting
something’ (he said before her), ‘or not wanting something else.’
She did not like her girls to learn so much writing or sewing, for
instance. Their second girl is to be brought up for medicine. So,
you see, Mr. and Mrs. P. must be advanced.</p>

<p class='c017'>“One day last week, we, <i>i.e.</i> Mrs. H., Dr. H., and I went to
lunch with Mrs. MacLaren. Mr. M. is Member for Edinburgh, and
Mrs. and Miss M., as you will perhaps remember, are working for
the Women’s Suffrage. I met there Dr. Guthrie’s youngest son,
a very fine young man, who made a strong impression on me. He
is evidently as fine in mind as in person.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In speaking of her visits, she had always much to
say of the interesting persons whom she met at Bonaly,
and of the talk she so thoroughly appreciated, well
described under the heading, “The Professor at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>Breakfast-Table,” in Mr. Meiklejohn’s “Life of Dr.
Hodgson,” as—</p>

<p class='c014'>“the sparkling table-talk, apt illustration, and racy anecdote with
which the doctor enlivened all the time we sat at table. Without
monopolizing the talk, he never allowed it to flag; and by manifesting
the kindliest interest in the sayings and doings of all, he
induced even the shyest to take his part in a manner that must
have astonished him when he came to look back upon it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Hodgson, too, had so much grace and kindness
that even this shyest of her guests was made so much
at home as to be “led to imagine that he must have
sat in that particular corner hundreds of times before,
though now for the first time conscious of it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Another of Miss Buss’ letters (Sept. 8, 1874) gives
an account of the place itself—</p>

<div class='c024'>“Bonaly, Sept. 8, 1874.</div>

<p class='c017'>“Edinburgh, to me, is full of you! So you have been constantly
in my mind since my arrival here, last Friday night.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Bonaly is five miles out of Edinburgh, but, on a clear day,
there is a splendid view of town, castle, and Arthur’s Seat. Only,
a ‘clear day’ is not a common article, for, since Friday, I have
seen little external sunshine, though, inside, there is plenty. But
Mrs. Hodgson herself is confined to bed, and looks so fragile that
a breath might blow her away. We trust, however, that she ‘has
turned the corner,’ as the doctor says she may be taken into
another room to-day....</p>

<p class='c017'>“This house is beautifully situated in twenty-eight acres of its
own grounds, and there are hills upon hills all round, except on the
Edinburgh side. Two tiny mountain ‘burns,’ or streams, run
through the grounds, with that constant blue haze over them—a
touch of beauty which we got rarely in the Alps. In these
northern latitudes, it seems to me that there never is the clear,
cloudless sky which we know as the <i>Italian</i>, but there is another
kind of beauty—that of the greyish-blue haze which envelopes
everything with a soft and indescribably beautiful mantle.</p>

<p class='c017'>“In consequence of Mrs. Hodgson’s health, I left my dear boy
at home, but if he had come, he and George (Dr. H.’s son) would
have been happy together.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>“Mr. Knox is expected here on Thursday. He has been asked
to meet me, and I hope he will come. How much you and I
liked him. Miss Blyth is also invited.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am writing in the midst of snatches of talk, which makes it
difficult to know what I am writing, but you will not mind jerky
sentences, with no particular thread of connection?...</p>

<p class='c017'>“There is a capital article on Woman’s Suffrage in this month’s
<i>Macmillan</i>; it is by Prof. Cairnes, in answer to Goldwin Smith’s
attack. You do not care so much for this question as I do, so
will scarcely feel the same interest in it.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Is Agnes pretty well? What is she doing, I wonder? Will
you give her my dear love when you write? There is a very
charming letter from Miss Hierta to me, which shall be sent to
you when I know where you are. What a very sweet woman
she is!</p>

<p class='c017'>“My Hythe holiday was very pleasant; we were such a large
family party. Did I tell you what darlings Frank’s brothers are?
Arthur (six years old) is quite a picture of infant beauty, with his
blue eyes and curly golden hair; and he says such funny things and
makes droll mistakes. He rushed at me once, saying, ‘Arnie,
look at my <i>apostles</i>!’ ‘Your what?’ ‘Apostles.’ I found he
meant <i>fossils</i>!</p>

<p class='c017'>“Another day he was reading: ‘And she sung a—a <i>hullabaloo</i>!’
He meant <i>lullaby</i>.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Then the baby-boy, whose only experience of trees and green
grass is the disused churchyard at Wapping, insisted on calling
every green field and clump of trees a ‘nice churchyard!’ Was it
not pathetic?</p>

<p class='c017'>“If you are writing to Miss Hopkins, please remember me most
kindly to her, and tell her I congratulate her on Miss Robinson’s
success: no doubt she has largely contributed to it.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I see Miss Robinson has gained her point, and there is really
a Soldier’s Institute at Portsmouth. The military element is strong
at Hythe, in the School of Musketry, and we can see how it is that
the scarlet uniform and gold trimmings are so popular. To poor
people the fine clothes and certain pay must be very attractive.
Contrast the dress and appearance of an agricultural labourer with
that of the labourer who has enlisted! And then think of the easy
life of the latter. Do not fancy <i>my</i> estimate of soldiers is altered.
I am looking at them from the point of view of the very poor, to
whom to have a soldier son or brother must be a grand promotion.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Mr. Knox came here on Thursday. I like him still very much,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>and he likes you and me. He asked most kindly after you. He
also sent a copy of ‘A Night and Day on board the <i>Mars</i>’ to be
forwarded to you, which I duly sent off. You know he is a staunch
teetotaller, and is working desperately in the cause. He said he
had known seventy-five men, of his <i>own</i> position, ruined by drink,
and Dr. Hodgson told me afterwards that this was no exaggeration.
The vice of drunkenness seems to prevail here more than in London,
at least one hears more of it.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Mr. Knox has nothing now to do with the Company’s schools,
but has given himself up to rescuing <i>boys</i> (I asked him where were
the <i>girls</i>?), and has been violently attacked for <i>kidnapping</i> them.
An absurd charge, of course. I fear he is not cold and hardheaded,
like the typical Scotchman. But, all the same, I like him
whenever I see him.</p>

<p class='c017'>“How true is what you say about the money matters of women!
But we are breaking through many of these things, and a later
generation of women will know what independence means. I hope
they will use it properly, for, after all, we cannot be independent of
each other. We have to live in a community.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“Bonaly, Sept. 8, 1874.</div>

<p class='c017'>“Your long and interesting letter has just come, dear Annie,
after one from me to you is written, sealed up, and put in the
post-bag.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I will read the letter in the <i>Spectator</i>. It seems to me that
Tyndall only says what you say, namely, that science, so far as he
knows, cannot <i>prove</i> God and immortality. But I do not see why
he need have said as much as he did, except that he is essentially
<i>aggressive</i>.</p>

<p class='c017'>“That people are unjust to him, I admit, and that this ignorance
of his subject and injustice drive him to attack.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“Bonaly, Sept. 14, 1874.</div>

<p class='c017'>“I return Mr. S.’s letter, with which Dr. Hodgson was much
amused, as was I. He admired J.’s poem, <i>Vivia Perpetua</i>, very
much, and said how good and sweet it was. He also begged me
to ask her whether she knows the ‘Vivia Perpetua’ of Mrs. Flower
Adams, whose sister Sarah is well known for her hymns. He
thought J.’s little poem might well do prefixed to the drama by Mrs.
Adams.</p>

<p class='c017'>“My dear Mrs. Hodgson is still in bed, where she lies so
patiently that she is a living lesson to me. It is curious, but she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>always makes me feel gentle and soft—a lesson I constantly need,
and no one else produces the same effect on me. Had I seen her
before my interview with E. D., the latter would not have been
frightened at my—what shall I say?—<i>violence!</i></p>

<p class='c017'>“You have a mesmerizing effect on me, but your influence is
quite different—more on the intellectual side, I think. Mrs. Hodgson
is the sweetest, brightest, most fairy-like woman I have ever known;
and the points of contact between her and me are so many. I have
such strong affection and respect for her husband—he is <i>so clever</i>,
and inspires one with a kind of awe for his knowledge (which is
in a line I can follow), his brilliancy, his wonderful power of
expression, his tenderness, his extreme conscientiousness, and his
resource. But no one would venture to take a liberty with him,
and I can well imagine the respectful awe in which his pupils hold
him. Then the eldest boy is so near Frank’s age, and I have had
so much to do with him that he is very dear to me. The two little
girls are perfectly charming.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Then the house is full of books, pictures, statues, busts, etc.
Every side of my taste is represented, and the books especially
are always delightful to me. I suppose the collection of educational
works is quite unique. Dr. H.’s religious views are very independent
of theology; but, as I have said, he is intensely reverent, and respects
other people’s opinions. His popularity with his Class in University
is immense, as I heard on Saturday, and I can well understand it
is so.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Mrs. H. is one of those women who is absolutely unselfish.
Her unselfishness extends <i>beyond</i> husband and children, and she
can always speak that soft word that turns away wrath. They are
well matched. She is dependent and clinging, in the best sense,
and he is intensely strong....</p>

<p class='c017'>“I should like some copies of J.’s ‘Lady Jane Grey.’ Will you
give her my love and ask her?</p>

<p class='c017'>“When I get home I must get a copy of ‘Hertha’ from Mudie’s.
I know there is one there.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I shall get back (<span class='fss'>D.V.</span>) refreshed in every way—intellectually,
physically and morally, and spiritually too, I hope.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In 1880 came the end of this bright chapter of her
life. The death of Dr. Hodgson brought back the
sufferings of the earlier loss in 1860, when Mr. Laing’s
death left so great a blank. Between 1875 and 1880
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>Miss Buss had lost her father, and Mr. and Mrs. Payne,
and now came the death of Dr. Hodgson and Miss
Chessar in the same month, to all of whom she had
been linked not only by the ordinary ties of life, in more
than ordinary strength, but also by very special sympathy
in her personal work.</p>

<p class='c006'>Extracts from her letters tell their own story. She
and Dr. Hodgson, with Miss Chessar, Miss Caroline
Haddon, Miss Franks, and some others, had gone to a
great educational congress held in Brussels, in which
many of them were to take active part. On August 21
Miss Buss writes to her sister—</p>

<p class='c014'>“A very pleasant journey yesterday. The water quite smooth,
and hardly any one ill. We are at present fourteen people and are
shaking down. I am now going to the Bureau to get my ticket for
the Teachers’ Conference, and then to the Exhibition.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“Aug. 23.</div>

<p class='c017'>“I am sorry to tell you that Dr. Hodgson is very ill. He has
had to come to our place, as really he could not be left. I am now
writing for an English doctor. If necessary, I must telegraph to
Mrs. Hodgson, or, if possible, must return with him to London,
telegraphing for her to meet him. It is very sad. He thinks it is
some heart affection, but no one can tell till the doctor has been.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“Aug. 24.</div>

<p class='c017'>“Dr. H. is so ill that it is feared he will die.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I have telegrammed to Mrs. Hodgson, but she cannot get here
till to-night at the earliest. I have been praying most earnestly
that he may live to see her. His lungs are congested, and he
breathes just as our father used to do.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I have now been with him thirty hours, but a most kind and
experienced teacher, Mr. Harris, a friend of Miss Haddon’s, is chief
nurse.”</p>

<p class='c005'>On August 17, before leaving Edinburgh, Dr.
Hodgson had written to his friend Mr. A. Ireland—</p>

<p class='c014'>“My courage fails me as the time draws near for going to
Belgium. For the first time in my life the thought of illness away
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>from home hangs upon me. I have had queer sensations and pains
in the heart.... The educational conference lasts from the 22nd to
29th inst. I have just received a huge 8vo. volume of 1000 pages,
and 3 lbs. 9½ ozs. in weight, containing preliminary reports for the
six sections into which the conference is divided.”</p>

<p class='c005'>While in London he consulted a medical man, who
assured him that he was suffering only from indigestion.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the fatigue and heat of travelling brought on
attack after attack of <i>angina pectoris</i>, and on the evening
of August 24 the end came.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of this terrible three days Miss Buss writes—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I do not think there has ever been so awful a time in my life;
in other griefs my brothers were by my side, and able to help. In
this, everything has fallen on me, and in a foreign country, too.
Had it not been for Miss C. Haddon and Mr. Harris it would not
have been physically possible for me to bear what I have had to go
through. Also the girls of my party were very helpful.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Dear Mrs. Hodgson does not, as she says, at present understand
things. It is a dream to her: she arrived just twelve hours
too late.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It is too real to me to be a dream; his dear voice is still
sounding in my ears; he was so patient and so grateful, thanking
us all each time we gave him seltzer-water, etc.</p>

<p class='c017'>“But I had no idea of death till within a few hours of the end.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I was with him just thirty-seven hours. He called for me at
five o’clock on Monday morning. I went at once and gave him
some brandy, and then sent for the doctor while Miss Chessar
stayed with him.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Dearest mother, I long to have you and my boy safe in my
arms—to make sure of you both.</p>

<p class='c017'>“How I loved my dear friend no words can express. How glad
I was to have him as my guest, and to travel with him! Such an
opportunity had never occurred before.”</p>

<p class='c005'>From this date some part of Miss Buss’ holiday was
always spent with Mrs. Hodgson, whose own words,
after her friend had been taken from her, show what
this friendship was to her also,</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>“You ask me to tell you something of my friendship with Miss
Buss. I could only do so by giving you a long list of kindnesses
received from her, kindnesses which made one wonder how a
woman leading such a busy life could remember such things as
birthdays, not only of one’s own, but of one’s children and grandchildren,
none of whom were ever forgotten. The terrible anxiety
she went through at Brussels in 1880, during the Educational Congress
there, must have told heavily on her nerves, already sorely
taxed. My husband went with her to Brussels, and when she found
him ill and suffering at his hotel, she took him to her lodgings and
gave up one of her rooms, which at that time were very difficult to
get, Brussels being very full, and devoted herself to nursing him
night and day for the short and fatal illness. I can never tell you
of all she went through to help me, but can only say that when we
arrived at Bonaly Tower, near Edinburgh, where we brought our
beloved, she was very ill, the result of what she had gone through,
not only to nurse her old friend, but when all was over to help and
comfort me, utterly forgetful of self. Ever since that sad time she
has been more than a sister to me. I fear now I took advantage
of her wonderful goodness, her wise judgment, her strict sense of
justice, her unselfishness, and learned more and more to consult
her, who was the friend and helper of all who stood in need of help.
To me her loss is irreparable, and I believe I am only one of a
great many who went to her in times of trouble.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But this sorrowful experience was not the only grief
of that year, for Miss Chessar never left Brussels again,
surviving Dr. Hodgson less than a month. She had
not been strong, but no one had in the least anticipated
anything serious, and this second blow, following so
closely on the first, greatly affected Miss Buss, who thus
lost by one stroke the two persons who were the
greatest help and strength in her work. Like herself,
they were both teachers of remarkable power, and the
three friends had set themselves to raise the general
standard of teaching, while at the same time their
sympathies in other directions cemented a close friendship.</p>

<p class='c006'>The force of this double loss is given very clearly in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>the replies from Mrs. Grey and Miss Shirreff to letters
from Miss Buss, these letters themselves not being
attainable—</p>

<div class='c024'>“Meran,</div>
<div class='c039'>“Sept. 20, 1880.</div>
<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>My dear Miss Buss</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“It was only yesterday that we heard, from Miss
Brough, of the death of Miss Chessar, and I write in both our
names to express our deep and affectionate sympathy with you in
this second, and, I fear, even heavier loss, coming so soon after Dr.
Hodgson’s death. Our own sense of loss is very heavy; though
we knew her so little in private life, she had inspired us with real
and warm personal regard, besides admiration for her remarkable
powers. We are anxious that a fitting obituary notice should appear
in the <i>Journal</i>, if it is not already done, and have written to Miss
Brough to get it done. Will you help her to do full justice to your
common friend? And please, whenever you have a moment’s
leisure, let us hear how you are yourself.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It grieves us to hear how your sorely needed holiday has been
turned into a day of sadness and mourning by these two deaths.
Dr. Hodgson’s must have been such a terrible shock, and from its
circumstances have brought upon you so much to try you, in
addition to the personal loss. We women have lost in him a
friend such as we shall not see again, and he was one of the few
left in this dull generation who could fight with wit as well as
earnestness, and had always a good story to clinch an argument.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I cannot hear of all the good work going on without a pang at
being so unable to join in any of it, and all my idleness and care of
my useless self has not brought me any nearer, that I can see or
feel, towards ever joining in it again!... We go to Florence and
then to Rome, where I hope we shall see you in the Christmas
holidays. With love from us both, ever, dear Miss Buss,</p>
<p class='c026'>“Your affectionate</p>
<p class='c027'>“<span class='sc'>Maria G. Grey</span>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In November, Mrs. Grey writes again—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Your letter made us very sad. The loss of two such friends
as Dr. Hodgson and Miss Chessar coming upon you under such
circumstances, and so close together, was enough to break you down
utterly, but, as you do not mention your health, we trust it did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>suffer. We cannot help hoping that the distressing effect will have
worn away enough to let your old elasticity of spirits and love
of Rome restore you, and that we may yet have the pleasure of
welcoming you here at Christmas.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Buss had written to say that Rome was not
possible for this year, and in response Miss Shirreff
speaks of one part of her letter—</p>

<p class='c014'>“How true is what you say of the terrible void in one’s life
from the loss of early friends, but, believe me, dear Miss Buss,
later friendships may become very close and dear, and you are far
indeed from having overpast the age for making them. Those to
whom mental sympathy has always been the strong, if not the
strongest, link in friendship, have in this case a great advantage
over others, because, while we outlive other and lighter needs of our
nature, the need for mental companionship never is lost, and this
enjoyment can never cease to give, after close affection, the truest
zest to life. It is therefore never too late to meet with it, though we
become slower in discerning it when it exists. But you have not
reached that point, and with the full vigour of mental faculty you
are ready to seize the full enjoyment of what responds to your own
nature. In hours of sorrow we are so apt to feel the burden of years
that we acquiesce too readily in the privations they seem to bring.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I hope your quiet holiday-time spent with your old friend will
send you back strengthened and hopeful to your work. I cannot
express how much we feel your goodness in having added to it the
guidance of this new school (the Maria Grey Training School)
through its difficult early years. Mrs. Grey joins in love, and says
she will write another day.</p>
<p class='c026'>“Ever affectionately yours,</p>
<p class='c027'>“<span class='sc'>Emily A. Shirreff</span>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The visit to Mrs. Hodgson during the holidays did
much to comfort them both, and to strengthen the bond
that never relaxed to the end. The very latest pleasure
of Miss Buss’ life, in the bright interval that preceded
the fatal illness, was a visit at Myra from this loved and
loving friend.</p>

</div>
<p class='c014'>“One who never turned his back, but marched straightforward;
Never doubted clouds would break;

Held we fall to rise, are baffled to fight better,
Sleep to wake!”</p>
<div class='c039'><span class='sc'>R. Browning.</span></div>
<p class='c015'>Strangers might easily receive the impression that
Miss Buss was one of those happy persons who, being
blessed with an iron constitution, do not know what
illness means. This was, however, very far from the
fact; for with a temperament so intensely sensitive, she
was in reality one of the women who can be as ill as
they choose to be; and a good deal of her apparent
vigour lay in the strength of the will which elected <i>not</i>
to be ill. “Great minds have wills, where feeble ones
have wishes.” It was just because she so well knew
what could be done by self-control that she exacted so
much self-control from all around her. From experience
she knew how largely the body may be made the instrument
of the spirit, and for much of her time she kept
going by sheer force of that indomitable will.</p>
<p class='c006'>It was because she carried this effort too far, in
exacting from her woman’s strength the work that
might have contented several strong men, that she grew
old before her time, and finally broke down, paying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>the price of overstrain for some years before the end
came.</p>

<p class='c006'>All that we can hear of her early life gives the
impression of perfect temper, of unfailing composure,
of unbroken self-command. It is only in later years,
when her great work was completed, that we find the
nervous irritability that is the price paid for over-work,
or, more truly, of over-worry, since it is not work that
kills, but worry.</p>

<p class='c006'>So much did all around her rely on her strength and
vigour that it is with surprise we note the recurrence in
her letters of such passages as these, even so many
years ago:—</p>

<div class='c024'>“September, 1872.</div>

<p class='c017'>“It is simply sickening to think of the crowds who come to me,
and I have been so ailing in health that I have only managed to
get along at all by sitting with Berlin woolwork in the evening,
going to no meetings, and getting to bed at ten o’clock. Also,
though to tell <i>you</i> this is dreadful, I have got through this week
only on champagne twice a day, with doses of iron!</p>

<p class='c017'>“The champagne has, I trust, done its work and set me up, so
I hope to go on without any more until next time! My throat has
been affected without intermission this term, and the sleepless
nights have almost driven me to opiates or to a doctor. But I
think I am better, and the holidays are coming near.</p>

<p class='c017'>“This is the history of every term, however, and the question
will arise, how long such a strain can be borne? I do my best to
keep in health, but over-strained nature will have her way sometimes.
This is perhaps a new light on my inner life. But, my dear
Annie, remember <i>every one</i> thinks I am a proper person on whom
to make claims....”</p>

<p class='c005'>This inability to meet claims to which she would so
gladly have given full space was a very wearing part of
the overcrowding of her life. Here is a regret that she
was compelled to seem to neglect a friend for whom she
would have done anything in her power:—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Her letter pains me, in a sense, because I know how heavy is
the trial of waiting and doing nothing when there is the will to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>work. If only I had some leisure I might go to her and <i>talk</i>
with her.</p>

<p class='c017'>“But I can give nothing except to those who can come to me,
and not always, or even often, then. Do not say anything. As
the work goes on, we may see a way to keep her interested in, and
cognizant of, our part of it.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I had no idea of how much she had cared for me in the past
days, and it is very touching to know it.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“March, 1873.</div>

<p class='c017'>“... I hope you have not been thinking harshly of me for not
answering your note or calling, but if you have, you must in imagination
take my place, which is at all times fit to be occupied by ten
ordinary women, but which, at the end of the <i>school year</i>, with all
the examinations and prizes, is large enough for twenty.”</p>

<div class='c024'>“December 9, 1873.</div>

<p class='c017'>“I am going to bed now (eight o’clock), and hope to be better
for a night’s rest.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Here I am again a prisoner in my room! A sore throat is
the main cause....</p>

<p class='c017'>“But I am generally out of sorts. I am learning that I cannot
do as I used, and that body will dominate mind and will.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I fear you are no better. You had my news? It seems to me
quite foolish for me to be ill and unable to do my work when the
path became suddenly clear, and all so quiet too!...</p>

<p class='c017'>“Dearest Annie, my love to you. Lately I have often seemed
to want you, but I have never been so long and so completely
broken down—except there was organic disease, when I had fever—as
I have this term, and therefore unable to go to you.</p>

<p class='c017'>“There is a lecture at the College of Preceptors to-morrow
night, on ‘English as a Means of Philological Instruction,’ by Dr.
Morris—the Morris. 7.30. Could you go? If so, could you join
me here a few minutes before seven? Only Miss Fawcett is going.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am better in myself, but cannot yet stand upright or walk
about. Patience is teaching me a great lesson, and I hope I am
learning it, in part, at least.</p>

<p class='c017'>“... I really think there have never been so many petty
worries crowded together.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It is all very well for men to say ‘never mind.’ However,
what is to be will be, and strength comes with the need.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am much better in health. Why, do you think? I went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>on Saturday to my uncle’s perfectly quiet house, and out of the 48
hours slept 25!—2½ hours each afternoon, and 10 hours each night.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am feeling so much better to-day—I slept <i>well</i> last night.
But one of the distressing signs of over-work is disturbed and light
sleep, and my brain is so constantly at work in day-time that I
need deep sleep. So cause and effect act and react.</p>

<p class='c017'>“My heart has been wrung too by Mr. Payne’s death. Life
seems so full of anguish as one gets older, that at times I seem to
have no power of being bright and cheerful.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In addition to the regular work of the school, and
all the claims of outside work and of pupils and friends,
there was a large amount of wear and tear inevitable in
any undertaking on so vast a scale. There was also
much that was painful connected with the success of
the public movement, so far as it affected small private
schools or the work of ordinary governesses, who all
seemed to urge some moral claim to compensation. It
was impossible for the kind heart not to suffer even
when the clear head denied the validity of the cause of
the suffering, as in this letter in reference to one such
case:—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I wonder dear A. does not remember that when a man makes
a new invention, and thereby ruins many individuals, he is not
expected to compensate them.</p>

<p class='c017'>“They suffer in the interests of the greater number, and, if wise,
direct their efforts towards working the new invention or improving
on it. This may seem cruel, but it is not so in the end. There is
no reason, human or divine, why A. B. C., etc., should put aside a
direct benefit to themselves and others in order to prevent Z. from
turning his attention to some other field of work than that he
already occupies. It is certain that three hundred girls in one
school want as much teaching as thirty girls in ten schools—only
they want different teaching.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Moral—the big school displaces labour, but does not crush it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In the mere fact of success itself there was trial
enough in many ways. The intensity of her feeling
might be sometimes out of due proportion to the cause
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>of suffering, but none the less did she suffer acutely.
At the time of greatest triumph—the opening of the
new schools in 1879—there chanced to be one example
which gave rise to an outbreak of indignation on
her part, letting us see how much had hitherto been
hidden even from her friends. Of this incident she
writes—</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is of no use to try to please people! I do not mean to try.
I will do what seems to me right, and then learn to be content to
be abused, if <i>I can!</i> What with every one’s ‘claims,’ and with
people’s ‘rights’ to a seat, always the best!—friends, family,
parents, old pupils, etc., it is all the same! Every one is dissatisfied,
do what one will; some one else is preferred, some one
is neglected.... And so the stings go on, till I nearly break
down under the wounds they inflict. When barely able to get
about again through the work, I hear of my neglect, etc., of one to
whom, in my heart of hearts, it never occurred to me as possible
that any one could accuse me of ingratitude.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Pray forgive me, dear Annie, but you can never know the bitter
price one pays for success. I think it as heavy as that of failure!
This has stirred up a depth of scorn and anger of which I feel
ashamed, though I feel almost ashamed, too, of the race of beings
to which I belong.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I do not know whether it will do any good to have it out, so
to speak, with you. I fear perhaps it will worry you. But as I
have written it, it shall go, and I hope you and I shall meet next
Saturday, when the keenness of the stroke has passed. I do not,
however, think that just now I can write to our friends. I should
not wish to pain them, so silence will be my best refuge. Do not
please say anything. I will fight my fight out with myself alone.</p>

<p class='c017'>“God’s law of compensation comes in; He will neither suffer
one to be unduly elated nor depressed.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It is part of our discipline in life that we should constantly
fail, and I earnestly hope that I may be permitted to try and try
again.</p>

<p class='c017'>“But the old days have gone, and it would be better as well as
easier for me for no visitors to be allowed to enter except the few
on the platform and the mothers of girls taking prizes <i>high in the
school</i>.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Trying to please every one, and to recognize his or her rights,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>is not of the least use. Like the miller in the fable, one only
succeeds in pleasing no one.</p>

<p class='c017'>“There is so much to be grateful and thankful for that I am
really ashamed of myself for feeling vexed. I have not told you
half the vexations to which people subject me, certainly not because
I ignore them, but because by trying to please it seems impossible
to succeed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Earlier in this “year of triumph” there is a pathetic
little note to her sister, showing how much stronger was
the “domestic” than the public woman in her—</p>

<div class='c024'>“February 18, 1879.</div>

<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>Dearest little Mother</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'>“Don’t be unhappy, but you did not think how much
I miss your loving little hug and petting.</p>

<p class='c017'>“No one pets me but you, and occasionally Mrs. Bryant.
Darling boy allows me graciously to pet him, but he does not make
advances to me.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I want you sometimes, if only to look at!</p>

<p class='c017'>“Where are we to go at Easter? I was thinking of Hastings.
Let me know.</p>

<div class='c039'>“Your very loving old</div>
<div class='c039'>“<span class='sc'>Arnie</span>.”</div>

<p class='c005'>It is not necessary to say that no change really took
place in Miss Buss’ endeavours to respond to even the
most unreasonable of demands. When she met me at
Ben Rhydding soon afterwards, she was just as sweet
and bright as ever, and her nerves rapidly recovered
tone again. This power of recuperation after even the
severest strain was always remarkable, even to the very
last. We had a striking proof of it in the spring of
1893, when Miss Buss joined my sister and me at
Bordighera. We had tried to get her to take the complete
rest of a whole winter abroad after her illness in
the autumn before, holding out the attractions of
Florence, Siena, and the Italian lakes. Every one
wanted her to give up work for a time, and take the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>chance of real recovery. Our efforts were all wasted,
and all she would do was to come, with her cousin, Miss
Mary Buss, and a friend, late in the spring, stopping at
various points in the Riviera on the way. She was far
from well on her arrival, but a drive to San Remo in an
open carriage on a windy day gave her a chill, followed
by the inevitable attack of influenza. There was also
a passing giddiness which gave us anxiety. She was
certainly very ill for five days, with a threatening of
pneumonia. But, thanks to her power of sleeping day
and night, the attack passed off as rapidly as it had
come on, when nothing we could say could persuade
her that there had been ground for alarm; an opinion
she maintained in the face of the most authoritative
medical support of our view. On the Sunday she had
certainly been very ill, but on Tuesday she would have
been downstairs if we had not made too strong a protest.
On Thursday, however, she insisted on starting for
England, and accomplished the journey to London
without a break, and apparently with no ill consequences.</p>

<p class='c006'>She had already suffered from frequent attacks of
influenza of a more or less serious character, leaving
behind them more and more weakness. The first
attack dated from the winter of 1889–90, when we were
all in Rome together. I had suffered from what seemed
a sudden sharp cold, but was nearly well when Miss
Buss and her party arrived in Rome on Christmas Eve.
Christmas Day was very wet, and as my room was
large and airy all assembled there for afternoon tea and
talk, Miss Buss being full of fun and interest. But after
a few days she and several others developed the same
kind of cold, which, even then, we never identified
with the mysterious disease of which every one heard
so much that year. But for us both it proved the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>beginning of a series of attacks extending through the
next four years. More than once when she was at the
worst, I was too ill even to be told of it till the danger
had passed. This was the case in the autumn of 1893,
and I had been suffering during the summer, and able
to see her only when she came to visit me.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was during this summer that she finally moved
from Myra Lodge to No. 87, next door, leaving the
boarders with Miss Edwards. The door of communication
was still left, that Miss Buss might see her friends
and the girls when she felt able. She had her own
companion, Miss Newman, and, later, Miss Millner; but
Miss Edwards, having been so many years with her, still
went often to see her. There seemed every prospect
of years of rest and ease, amid a circle which could
profit by her experience and wisdom.</p>

<p class='c006'>There were all the inevitable delays, in getting
into the new house, even though the workmen worked
with all their hearts for an employer who took very
special care of their creature comforts, and made them
wish “for more like her.” She was not accustomed to
summer in London, and the consequence of it all was
the very serious attack, already mentioned, in the
autumn. She recovered, however, with something of
the rapidity of the experience in the spring, and was
able to go to Bournemouth, and afterwards to spend
Christmas at her cottage at Epping.</p>

<p class='c006'>When my sister and I returned from Italy, in May,
1894, we were very much grieved to see the change in
our friend. She looked many years older, and was
quite unfit for any sort of exertion. It was surprising
how easily she accepted the changed conditions, and,
after her life of so much activity, was quite content to
be amused, finding special pleasure in Miss Millner’s
lovely little Persian kitten. It was very touching to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>see her intense amusement in her subjection to her new
medical attendant, Dr. Cobbett, the successor to her old
friend Dr. Evershed. She even seemed to find a lively
satisfaction in the discovery of a will which could
dominate her own.</p>

<p class='c006'>There was one bright spot in this summer, in a visit
to “The Haven,” near Hythe, the pleasant home of her
friend Mrs. Pierson, from which she returned so well
that she went to the Norfolk coast with Miss Millner
and Mr. and Mrs. W. K. Hill. But the weather was
cold, and Mr. and Mrs. Septimus Buss, who joined her
at Overstrand, were thankful to get her safely home
again.</p>

<p class='c006'>The change in our dear friend, with the manifest
certainty that she must soon retire from her work, had
made me look out her old letters, and begin to arrange
the material she had prepared for the long-talked-of
story of the school, which I wished to have ready when
the day of retirement should come. On my last visit
to her, early in November, she was so much stronger
that she talked in quite the old way, telling me that she
intended to amuse herself by dictating her reminiscences
to a shorthand writer. I then told her what I had been
doing, and she became quite eager that we should do
it together. On November 12th I had a note fixing
the next day for the first of these meetings. I was
unfortunately prevented from going, thus losing that
last precious evening of her active life—a lasting regret.</p>

<p class='c006'>Early the next day the fatal illness began with an
attack of unconsciousness. In a letter from the Rev.
Alfred J. Buss, he says—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Though my sister had been in ill health for a long time, she
had rallied so often that much hope still remained. She had been
at the school several times during last term, and attended a meeting
of ‘old pupils.’ This last may have been too much for her. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>had an attack from which she was unable to rally. There had
been a consultation a few days before, and the medical men saw
no reason why she should not then be better—and allowed me to
inform the governors so—though she would still be liable to relapses.
So that the end came unexpectedly.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She had recovered from several similar attacks, and
had latterly seemed so much stronger that there had
been every reason for hope during the periods of consciousness
that came from time to time, although a new
symptom had appeared in the extreme restlessness that
alternated with the lethargy.</p>

<p class='c006'>For six weeks hope came and went, everything
being done that love could devise or devotion carry out.
In addition to the two constant companions, there were
two trained nurses: and the dear patient, in the quiet
intervals, was her sweetest self; so careful about giving
trouble, and so courteous in her acknowledgment of
service rendered, so grieved that the nurses should be
kept up at night, and so anxious that Miss Millner and
Miss Edwards should know how much she felt their
kind attention.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Edwards gives some interesting details of these
last months after the return home from this last holiday,
when, after a few weeks of care and nursing, she had
seemed better than at any time during the year:—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Three weeks of peaceful, quiet enjoyment followed this illness,
during which Miss Buss received many of her friends at her own
house, and was further made happy by a visit from her old and
intimate friend, Mrs. Hodgson, who has since written: ‘I am very
thankful that I had such a sweet, happy time with my friend before
the last illness came, and when she could in a measure enjoy life.’</p>

<p class='c017'>“During this period of improved health Miss Buss paid her
last three visits to the school she loved so dearly, visits that will
not soon be forgotten by those who then saw her. On October
31st she was present in the evening at the ‘old pupils’’ meeting,
and on November 2nd, during part of the school concert, and, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>her usual sympathetic thought of others, sent on each occasion
for several of the music teachers and others of the staff to sit by
her in turn and exchange a few words.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The last occasion on which our dear head-mistress was at
Sandall Road was on November 7th, when she distributed the
holiday prizes, making kindly inquiries, as each girl whom she knew
came before her, for parents and brothers and sisters at home, and
taking special notice of the little ones, for whom she had brought
a large packet of sweets.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Before this illness came on she had with her own hands
arranged all her Christmas gifts and ordered her Christmas cards,
received by many of her friends on that sad Christmas Day. There
were also some packets addressed by herself of mementoes to
friends, all the more precious for this evidence of thoughtful
foresight.</p>

<p class='c017'>“On Saturday, November 10th, friends came to lunch, and
Miss Buss was well enough to enjoy their society, and show particular
interest in the children, finding games and other amusement
for them.</p>

<p class='c017'>“On this day also she had a visit from an old pupil—and
colleague—who brought her little baby-girl, asking permission to
call her <i>Frances Mary</i>, a request which greatly touched Miss Buss.
Constantly during her illness she spoke of her ‘little namesake
baby,’ who once, at the dear invalid’s special wish, was brought to
see her.</p>

<p class='c017'>“On November 11th Miss Buss attended the short morning
service at the church of St. Mary the Virgin, almost next door to
Myra Lodge.</p>

<p class='c017'>“On Monday evening she was able to be with the girls at
No. 89, enjoying, as she always did, to see them happy in playing
games.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The next day two old pupils took tea with her, and for the
Wednesday a luncheon-party of some of the clergy and workers
of Holy Trinity had been arranged. But this, by the doctor’s
orders, had to be postponed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>On the Thursday before the end there was a return
of consciousness for some hours, with full recognition
of her nephew, the Rev. Charles Caron Buss, the
“Charlie boy” of olden days, whom she now questioned
tenderly about his little curly-headed Kenneth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>her latest delight. She also recognized and talked with
Mrs. Alfred Buss. Then came her “own boy,” the
Rev. Francis F. Buss, and she was able to follow the
Service for the Visitation of the Sick, and to join once
more in the <i>Veni Creator</i>, and then, for the last time, in
the words of the Collect, so often on her lips, to seek
from the “Fountain of all Wisdom those things which
for our unworthiness we dare not, and for our blindness
we cannot, ask”—a prayer so meet for one who had
walked from earliest days so humbly with her God—a
prayer so soon to be answered by the revelation of “the
things prepared for them that love.”</p>

<p class='c006'>With this last self-surrender she let go her hold on
earth, sinking again into a state of coma that grew
deeper and deeper till it merged into the sleep of death.
It lasted for three whole days longer, during which her
family and a few intimate friends were unremitting in
their visits, though there was nothing to be done but
take a sad look at the dear face, and go away with the
terrible sense of change, as they thought of that still
form, those closed eyes, those unanswering lips from
which came now only that slow laboured breathing,
and remembered their friend as they had always known
her before, so alert, so alive to every touch, so quick of
response to the faintest appeal. The only break in this
long stillness came in the hymns which from time to
time were sung softly by the watchers at the bedside,
in the hope that those familiar sounds might penetrate,
beneath the silence.</p>

<p class='c006'>All Sunday night the family remained in expectation—almost
in hope—of the release which seemed so
near, waiting as they that watch for the morning.
Christmas Eve dawned, and, as the day advanced to
high noon, the heavy breathing grew more and more
quiet, till at length came perfect peace, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>watchers knew that their beloved had passed from
death to life.</p>

<p class='c015'>Fifty years of work! Of work that, had she been
other than she was, might have been mere thankless
drudgery; of work that, being what she was, remains a
living influence, spreading, in ever-widening circles, to
distances beyond compute. Fifty years of love, poured
out from a heart often disappointed, but never embittered;
often left unfilled, but never found empty; often strained
to utmost tension, but never relaxing its high energy.
Being as she was, refreshed by the living water, sustained
by the bread of life, the strength was hers that knows
neither drought nor famine.</p>
<p class='c006'>For more than forty years she had worshipped in the
same church—Holy Trinity—built by her friend the
Rev. David Laing, and afterwards held by her friends,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>the Rev. E. Spooner, the Rev. Charles Lee, and Dr.
Cutts.</p>

<p class='c006'>To this altar she came, through all her working time,
to renew the strength in which her work was done as
“Christ’s faithful soldier and servant to her life’s end.”
And here, when that end came, the last gleams of the
dying year fell on the white blossoms that hid all that
was mortal of that brave spirit, while the vast crowd
knelt to give thanks for a life which had made all life
so much the more worth living to themselves and to
all women who should come after them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The good die never!” There can be no end to
this high influence that for the half-century past has
gone out, carrying with it all that is true, all that is
pure, all that is lovely. It must still go on in the
centuries to come in added power, since</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>“Good, the more</div>
      <div class='line'>Communicated, more abundant grows.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>And yet, do we not too sadly feel that the end has
come for us, who will not again, while we tarry here,
look on that kind face, or feel the clasp of that hand
that seemed strength itself? We rejoice in the joy of
her immortality—here and hereafter—but for us, here
and now, there is the suffering of this present time,
which is “<i>not</i> joyous, but grievous.”</p>

<p class='c006'>How much she did! She worked till the last; till
those magnificent energies, which seemed inexhaustible,
were at length worn out.</p>

<p class='c006'>She “died in harness,” and we must not grudge her
what she would have chosen. But yet, how we wish it
might have been otherwise! That she might have
rested in time, to have saved herself to be with us a
little longer, an inspiration and strength to all; “a great
moral force in the educational world;” an example to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>all teachers, as well as to her own staff and her own
pupils; a joy to the friends who loved her; and to her
own nearest and dearest——? But here we pause
and are silent before her brother’s words: “I cannot
speak of what she was—and what her memory will
be—to her nearer relatives, and especially to us, her
brothers.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The details of the service in Holy Trinity and the
concluding ceremony in the quiet churchyard at
Theydon Bois, near her cottage at Epping, on the edge
of the Forest, are given by eye-witnesses, happy in
being permitted to be there to see and hear for themselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>Never, it seemed to me then, could physical disability
have pressed more heavily than during that
week—from Christmas Eve to New Year’s Eve—when,
although no farther distant than St. Leonard’s, I had
to submit to be absent, while so many friends were
doing honour to her whom we all loved and mourned.</p>

<p class='c006'>The events of the three days, so full of emotion,
could not be better told than as they are given in the
“Memorials” compiled in the beginning of the year,
by her old pupils—afterwards colleagues—Miss Edith
Aitken, Mrs. W. K. Hill (Eleanor M. Childs), and Miss
Sara A. Burstall, who record the scenes at Holy Trinity,
at Theydon Bois, and on the first day of the re-opening
of the schools.</p>

    <div>THROUGH THE GRAVE AND GATE OF DEATH.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>“It is the will of God that even to the most vigorous and faithful
of His servants there shall come, sooner or later, weakness and
decay of strength. There is nothing more simply sorrowful than
this, and yet it is an integral part of the providence of the world.
To the most fortunate and gifted life, full of great opportunities, to
which the character and personality were equal, to a life blessed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>with health and power and love and success and a large measure
of happiness, even to such a life comes old age, with its train of
disappointment and feebleness. It is true that the waning of a
noble life is often marked by a sweetening and mellowing of
character, which is in itself a triumph and a glory; but still the
growing earthly feebleness cannot be forgotten, and it is a sad thing
to watch the face change, and to hear the voice ever weaker and
the step ever feebler, and to know that strength is gone and will
come back no more in this life. The grasshopper has become a
burden; the night is at hand.</p>

<p class='c017'>“During the last year we have shared in such growing sorrow,
as we have watched the struggle of an eager and hopeful spirit
against increasing physical pain and weakness. We have hoped
against hope, for the spirit was still so willing, but the foreboding
was always there, and in the last dark days of the old year the end
came, irrevocably and, as it seemed, almost suddenly. No more
alternations, no more struggles; all was over.</p>

<p class='c017'>“What an oppression of loss and pain seemed to brood over us
as we waited through that dark winter’s morning in the dim church
full of mourning figures! Crowds of people witnessed to the wide-reaching
influence of the life of which we were thinking. The
solemn dignity of the occasion, as we caught a glimpse of one and
then of another who had come, each from his or her important
place and work, to take a part in this last ceremony of respect,
recalled the importance of the life-work now over. Especially did
the sight of such a veteran of the struggle as Miss Emily Davies
bring to mind touching memories of the fight for an ideal waged in
the beginning against great odds. Such had been this our leader—an
important force in the world, a mind of originating insight,
who had modified her age for good. But now all was over. We
had had the privilege of being with her, but we should have it no
more. Our lives for the future were to be poorer and smaller.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The tolling bell seemed to beat out such thoughts as we waited.
But these more general regrets are changed to the acuter stab of
personal grief, as the coffin is carried in and passes us close. It is
to this that the loved presence has come, and even this is for the
last time. A hundred personal details come back—her dress, her
favourite colours, her smile, the sound of her voice. Thus and thus
we knew her—and shall know her no more.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘The best is yet to be.’ We believe it, but we loved her as
she was.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It is hard to control our voices, but we are still her army. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>behoves us to show that we can respond to the word of command,
and so we take our part in the service, and all goes on in its
appointed order to the end. The coffin is carried out, and we
disperse on our further journey, sad and dreary, down to Theydon
Bois. Our minds are filled by thoughts of the past and of the
future. To many of us the best part of our lives is associated with
her. To how many has she not been a generous and inspiring
friend, who brought out all our best by her very belief in it? How
are we to go on without her? And how drearily ashamed we feel
of our worst, which we can never now amend before her.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It pleased God to let our final farewell be very beautiful. The
churchyard at Theydon lies on the slope of a hill, and the grave is
at the northern side of the low, red brick, country church. The
short winter day was drawing to its close already, and the western
sky was glowing with glorious red and gold. The procession was
marshalled in the road below, and the white-robed clergy came
down to meet us from out of the sunset light, as it seemed. Our
hymns of rest and triumph felt right and fitting then, as we thought
of her and not of ourselves. She had fought a good fight, and had
finished her course. The country fields lay bare about us, and the
branches of the trees, interlacing themselves between us and the
evening sky, were leafless. But everything was touched with a
most tender and beautiful light, as large, soft snow-flakes floated
gently down on the violets and white spring flowers with which we
covered her. And so we left her.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>“On the last day of the old year Holy Trinity Church, Kentish
Town, was filled to overflowing with those who had met to pay their
last tribute to her who had passed away from among us. The
greater number of the mourners consisted, as was natural, of past
and present pupils of the North London Collegiate and Camden
Schools, but in addition there were representatives of all branches
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>of education in the widest sense of the word. Among these we
may mention Rev. T. W. Sharpe (H.M. Chief Inspector of Schools),

<p class='c017'>“Long before the time appointed for the service—10 a.m.—every
seat in the church, which is said to hold about two thousand,
was filled, while many people were standing in the aisles. As the
coffin was brought in at the south door, the door by which Miss
Buss had entered Sunday after Sunday from the time the church
was built, the whole congregation rose to its feet, and remained
standing until the mournful procession reached the chancel. It
was impossible, even then, to realize that we should never again on
earth see that familiar face, never again hear the kindly words that
so often cheered and encouraged us in our darkest hours, making
us feel that, after all, life was worth living, and that each one of us
had her special work to do.</p>

<p class='c017'>“All the arrangements had been most carefully planned before.

<p class='c017'>“After the service, which was conducted by the Vicar (the Rev.
Dr. Cutts), Canon Browne, whose work in connection with the
Cambridge Local Examinations brought him for so many years
into such close contact with Miss Buss, delivered an address from
the chancel steps. He said the last rites were often performed over
those who were too young to have shown promise; over those who
had shown promise, and were cut off, as it seemed, prematurely;
over those who had lived longer, and had had no aim, done no
work in life; over those who had had noble aims, and had been
disappointed, or who, having seen the fulfilment of their aims, had
outlived their friends, and died silent and alone. How exactly the
opposite of all this was the record of Frances Mary Buss! She
had great aims, she had seen a noble work perfectly done, she was
surrounded to the last by affectionate friends. It was not too much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>to say that she was one of the most prominent actors in that which
had changed the face of a large area of human life. There were
many present who had played a large part in it, but he could not
name the living. Miss Anne Clough and Miss Buss were, of those
who had passed away, those who had developed the best of woman’s
nature, the latent power and charm of that intellect which was so
subtle in its intuition and so swift in its spring. Miss Buss had
reduced the wear and tear of effort by the improvement of method,
and had changed that which had been dull and flat and painful
into brightness and interest. Thousands of girls’ lives had been
made happier, hundreds of women were now doing congenial
woman’s work through her means. It was difficult to believe that
it had all grown from nothing in thirty years. It was not with her
as with many—that others had laboured, and she had entered into
their labours; she was herself the pioneer, and herself had crowned
the work. It had not been done from policy; it had all come from
love and sympathy, combined with that practical intuition which
always lays its finger on the important point. Now her task was
o’er, that faithful labourer, under whom a wilderness had grown
into a garden, the garden had blossomed into flowers so fair, had
borne fruit so sweet. It was the last day of the year, the eve of a
New Year. The Church’s lessons brought before them that
beautiful chapter of the Revelation which described the new
heavens and the new earth. Miss Buss’ quiet and decided religious
character enabled them to enter without hesitation on that branch
of thought. Her religious character shone naturally throughout
her educational work. They read of the garnishing of heaven with
precious stones of various hues and many names, not there because
of this hue or that, of this characteristic or the other, but because
they were precious stones. In all reverent faith they followed in
imagination the placing of their friend, now lost here, among the
precious stones in heaven, and they might pray that of themselves
it might be true that she was but gone before.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The second part of the service was performed in the little
churchyard of Theydon Bois, near ‘Boscombe.’ The journey
seemed to be made doubly sad by the remembrance of the many
delightful holidays we had spent at ‘The Cottage,’ and by all its
associations; and yet we felt that we would rather she were laid to
rest there, in the open country, than in a crowded London cemetery.
‘After life’s fitful fever she sleeps well.’</p>

<p class='c017'>“The day was piercingly cold, in spite of the bright sunshine,
and the ground was covered with snow. About six hundred went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>down to Theydon Bois by a special train, and the long procession
was formed at the foot of the hill on which the church stands. Mr.
Garrod, Secretary of the Teachers’ Guild, Mr. Foster Watson,
Master of Method at Aberystwith College, Mr. Pinches, Treasurer
of the College of Preceptors, and Mr. W. K. Hill, Head-Master of
the Kentish Town School, acted as marshals. At two o’clock, the
hearse and carriages with the chief mourners reached the spot, and
the long train of mourners, headed by the clergy, the Rev. C. E.
Campbell, Vicar of Theydon Bois, Canon Barker, and Canon
Browne, moved slowly up the hill. Immediately behind the clergy
came the girls’ choir, singing ‘How bright the glorious spirits
shine.’ The voices, subdued as they were, owing to the great
length of the procession, had—if one may so express it—a wonderfully
spiritual effect. The churchyard was quite filled with the
mourners, and after the actual service was finished, Canon Barker
delivered a short address to those assembled round the open grave
on the life-work and lessons taught by Miss Buss, whose name, he
said, would be connected with the commencement of the higher
education of women for many years to come. He dwelt on the zeal
and ability displayed by the deceased in founding the great school
in Camden Town, and the most important educational testimony
she had given before the Schools Commission. Miss Buss also
established the Head-mistresses’ Association and the Teachers’
Guild, and her schools were the models of those of the Girls’ Public
Day School Company. The effect and success of her work was
seen at Girton and Newnham Colleges, and at the London
University, and he mentioned the fact that at one time at least
two-thirds of the girls at Girton were from Miss Buss’ own school.
The chief point in regard to her character was her remarkable
personality and indomitable strength. Her simplicity and singleness
of heart were without a taint of personal ambition. He
dilated on her great power of assimilating new ideas, and said the
influence of her will was extraordinary. Her name would live for
years, and the women not only of this country, but of every other,
owed her a debt of gratitude for the noble work she had accomplished.
He touched upon her deep religious character, manifested
so clearly in her quiet advice and consolation to the girls who
came to her in any worry or trouble, and finally he said it was a
blessing to any one to be able to see, as Miss Buss had done, her
life’s work crowned with success before she departed.</p>

<p class='c017'>“In compliance with the expressed wish of the family, comparatively
few wreaths were sent, but these were quite as many as could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>well be dealt with. In addition to those from members of the
family, the teachers of the North London Collegiate School sent a
wreath of laurel, the Camden School teachers a wreath, Miss Ridley
(a Governor of the school from its early days) and Miss J. T.
Ridley a wreath, Myra Lodge an anchor of violets, while the pupils
festooned and decorated the hearse. Most of those present carried
flowers, which they threw into the ivy-lined grave.</p>

<p class='c017'>“For the greater part of the service large flakes of snow had
been slowly falling. The day will ever remain in our hearts.
Though one of deep sadness, yet there was withal a feeling of
gratitude that we, too, had known her, and of pride that we were
Miss Buss’ girls.</p>
<div class='c039'>“<span class='sc'>Eleanor M. Hill.</span>”</div>

<p class='c005'>It is impossible to do more than merely indicate the
feeling caused by the death of Frances Mary Buss, as
evidenced in the piles of letters addressed to her family,
and to Mrs. Bryant and members of the staff, by leaders
in the educational world, as well as by pupils, past and
present, and by friends from every part of the globe.
The extracts already given will serve to represent this
deep and widespread sense of loss, and to show in how
many hearts her memory will live on.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of outward and visible memorials there are several
still in progress. One only is as yet completed, a
window given by relatives and friends to Holy Trinity
Church, where, on October 3, a special dedicatory
service was held. The subject is St. Scholastica, the
devoted sister of St. Benedict who founded Monte
Cassino, the first monastery of the Western Church.
St. Scholastica is said to have helped largely in the
revival of religion and learning that marked the sixth
century. She became the Head of the first community
of nuns, and it is in this character that she is represented
in the upper part of the window. In the lower part she
is seated, with one of her young novices at her knee, in
keeping with her name, and with the work of the great
teacher thus commemorated, whose likeness is plainly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>recognizable in the features of the saint. Above the
head of the upper figure runs a scroll with the words,
“I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith”
(Rev. ii. 19). The inscription below is, “In loving
memory of Frances Mary Buss, for forty-five years a
communicant of this Church.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The memorial window in the Clothworkers’ Hall,
Sandall Road, which is to be the gift of the Company,
is still in progress. The design represents four typical
women from sacred history, all peculiarly appropriate—</p>

<p class='c014'>I. Deborah, “a mother in Israel” (Judg. v. 7).</p>

<p class='c017'>II. Huldah, “the prophetess,” with whom “many communed”
(2 Kings xxii. 14).</p>

<p class='c017'>III. Mary, who “chose the better part” (Luke x. 42).</p>

<p class='c017'>IV. Phœbe, “a servant of the Church, and a succourer of many”
(Rom. xvi. 1).</p>

<p class='c005'>A portrait is introduced into the design.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the Camden School there is to be a marble bust,
the gift of the same generous donors, who have already
done so much to beautify the schools.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the memorial which would most have pleased
her whose name it will bear is in the Travelling Scholarships,
to which the public subscriptions are to be devoted.
In keeping with the large-heartedness which knew no
bounds, the benefit of these Scholarships will not be
confined to the two schools of which she was the founder.
It is hoped that many a worn and jaded teacher may
thus derive from foreign travel the rest and refreshment
which so often sent Miss Buss herself back to work
with renewed vigour; and it can scarcely be doubted
that in extent these Scholarships will prove worthy of
one who so largely gave to others.</p>

<p class='c006'>The account given by Miss Burstall of the re-opening
of the school after the great change that had come upon
it is full of interest—</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>“The opening of school on the first day of term was a strange,
but inspiring and impressive, ceremony, which none of those
present are likely to forget. The dark ranks of the girls, as they
stood for prayers, the black dresses of the teachers, the laurel
wreath hung above our dear Founder’s portrait, the empty great
chair, which would never be filled again by her we had seen
there so often—all told the story which the funeral hymns<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c018'><sup>[21]</sup></a> sung
before and after prayers reiterated. When the short, very short,
service was concluded, the Rev. A. J. Buss came forward, and first,
on behalf of the family, thanked the staff for their work (a very
labour of love indeed) in organizing the funeral arrangements, and
the girls for their singing on the sad occasion. He then, as Clerk
to the Governors, went on to say that the Governors had been unable,
owing to the shortness of the time that had elapsed, to make
any final arrangement, but that they had asked Mrs. Bryant to take
the post of <i>acting</i> Head-mistress during the term.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Mrs. Bryant, after saying a few words in response to Mr. Buss,
gave a short address, expressing (as she said) the thoughts and
memories that rose to the surface in trying to realize the greatness
of the leader who had passed from among us. Sympathy,
absolute devotion of self, extraordinary energy of will, marvellous
charity—these one thought of as they had been shown year after
year in counsel, in delight in other’s pleasures, in carrying ideas into
action, in patience and help to inferior workers, in honour and
appreciation to talent, in raising the weak, in strengthening the
strong.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The thrill of emotion, of loyalty, of sorrow, and of hope, which
passed through the hearts of so many of us as she spoke, is too
personal, too sacred for expression. It was a relief when music,
that divine art which begins where words end, came to speak regret
and aspiration, as the solemn chords of the Dead March in ‘Saul’
flowed from the organ. Just at this moment, a little after 9.30 a.m.,
a winter thunderstorm rolled up. The light grew fainter, the wind
sounded round the building; still the music pealed on as the darkness
gathered, rising stronger and fuller in its confidence of triumph
over death, when, just at the climax of the melody, a flash of
lightning blazed for an instant like an answering fire from the
heavenly world. It was a strange coincidence, but it was not the first
time that Nature had seemed to sympathize with our grief and with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>our consolation. The flowers and the winter sunshine of New
Year’s Eve, the softly-falling benediction of the snow in the churchyard
at Theydon—these had their meaning. So, too, had the
symbol of power, of energy, of light in darkness, when the New
Year began with its new work and its new, yet old, inspiration.”</p>

<div class='footnote c021' id='f21'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r21'>21</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“The saints of God, their conflict passed,” and “Peace, perfect
peace.”</p>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The music ceased, and all stood for a moment in
silence, till, as Miss Fawcett tells us—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mrs. Bryant said very quietly, ‘The classes will now pass to
their own rooms as usual!’ and, as we obeyed, the clouds cleared
away, and the place was soon flooded with brilliant sunshine. ‘Le
roi est mort: vive le roi!’ was the thought in all minds. But our
new Head had taken her stand on the old order of things, and there
is sweetness in our sadness.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Owing to some technicalities which could not be set
aside, the post of Head-mistress was still not filled
officially either on the Foundation Day or Prize Day,
June 27, 1895, and these may therefore be counted as
the last days of the old <i>régime</i>, the beloved Founder
still holding supreme rule, through the self-effacing
loyalty with which her successor did honour to the
cherished memory.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c018'><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f22'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r22'>22</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In a paper found in Miss Buss’ desk there is gratifying proof of the
satisfaction it would have given her to know of the choice of her successor—</p>

<p class='c020'>“I know Mrs. Bryant well, and think her the most competent woman
in the whole range of my acquaintance to take up my work after me. She
is bright, accomplished, energetic, and earnest. She is amiable and loving,
and, above all, has <i>vital force</i>. She has, indeed, ‘a healthy mind in a
healthy body.’ Pages of writing could not express more strongly my
conviction that she is the one woman who would and could carry on the
school in the same spirit as it is carried on now. Her fellow-workers
would also be loyal to her, and she would be considerate about them.</p>
<div class='c007'>(Signed)      “<span class='sc'>Frances Mary Buss</span>.</div>
<p class='c020'>“Myra Lodge, Feb. 3, 1878.”</p>
</div>

<p class='c006'>On Foundation Day (April 4)—henceforth to be
known as Founder’s Day—the sense of loss was manifest
in the black dresses of the staff, and in the absence of the
usual daffodils with which the Hall had been gay in past
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>times. The needlework was shown as usual, but in
place of the entertainment of other years, there was an
organ recital, followed by a selection of sacred music,
ending with the hymn, so deeply impressive to all there,
“The saints of God, their conflict passed.”</p>

<p class='c006'>On the Prize Day (June 27) there was a special
appropriateness in the fact that in Professor Jebb of
Cambridge, who occupied the chair, there should have
been so distinguished a representative of the University
which had been so much to one who had laboured to
open for others the way thither which she could not
herself follow.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the presence of Lady Frederick Cavendish, who
gave the prizes on this last day, there was also a very
special fitness, not only as a very active member of the
Council of the Girls’ Public Day Schools Company—a
work made possible in the beginning by Miss Buss’
success in her schools—but still more as the daughter
of Lord Lyttelton, one of the earliest friends to the
higher education of girls in general, and, in particular,
to the North London Collegiate and Camden Schools
for girls.</p>

<p class='c006'>The day was further marked as the close of the first
great period of the School’s history by the absence, not
only of the Head herself, but of two of her foremost
helpers—the Bishop of Winchester and Mr. Elliott—the
one suffering from the illness so soon to prove fatal,
and the other from sudden bereavement. So far back
as 1879 Miss Buss, in regretting the absence on the
opening of the new Hall of the Rev. Charles Lee, had
thus written of these three friends—</p>

<p class='c014'>“For years past Mr. Lee was the one person who was guide,
philosopher, and friend; who gave up his time, and who, with Mr.
Elliott and Mr. Thorold, met constantly in Camden Street, looked
after Myra Lodge as well as 202, worked up the law questions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>(Mr. Elliott has always <i>given</i> his law knowledge to me and to
the movement from the beginning), and in fact worked hard when
friends were few and success was apparently hopeless.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Lee’s removal from London deprived Miss Buss
of his valuable help, but for fifteen years longer Dr.
Thorold and Mr. Elliott were by her side in any time of
need, and their kind and genial speeches had come to
be an essential part of Prize Day rejoicing.</p>

<p class='c006'>And so the old order changes once again. But, no
longer looking sadly backward, we may turn hopefully
to the future, as past and present are united in the
heartfelt tribute to the Founder with which her successor
takes up the work of the school.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Last year I stood behind her in this place and read the Prize Day
report, which was <i>her</i> report, for her. To-day I am proud to
be her deputy once again and glad, for this day at least, of the
circumstances which have determined that as yet no one speaks in
her place as more than a deputy.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The thought of our School’s past—the pride in it, the regret
for it as past—must be specially with us all to-day. For the first
time in forty-five years we meet together for our yearly distribution
of prizes without the gracious presence of the Founder, a presence
so familiar, that cannot be replaced. A great teacher, a wise
administrator, a strong and sympathetic leader, she held a place
almost as unique in the educational world as the history of the
schools she founded. Nevertheless, the loss to us in this school is
deepest, widest, most intimate. To those who have been her
colleagues, the sense of it is ever present, in all the details of work,
and affecting all the relations of friendship.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Noble work like hers remains in effect for all time, and great
inspirations are immortal, passing on from mind to mind. The
neighbourhood knows, and will long know, our building as ‘Miss
Buss’ School,’ and our traditions have already lived too long to
lose the stamp of the character that moulded them. To guard
them with care, to act on them with zeal, will be the pleasure and
duty of every North London girl.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It is, I believe, hardly necessary, but I would like, before
concluding, to remind the pupils of the thanks that are due to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>teachers for their never-failing interest and devotion to work which,
though always cheering, is sometimes hard. For myself, I could
not adequately express, but I hope they know without words
how much I have appreciated their loyal support and their unity
of spirit as they have worked together with me during these last
six months. The dark cloud through which we have passed has
caused us all as colleagues to draw closer together, like children in
a family when the head has gone forth.”</p>

<p class='c005'>We find the same spirit in the account given in the
<i>School Magazine</i> of Mrs. Bryant’s election, on July 9,
as Miss Burstall concludes—</p>

<p class='c014'>“It was a quiet day, and a very simple ceremony. There was
something of the sweetness and ease of home in it all, and indeed
we felt as if we were a family rather than a school; and, as in the
beautiful and sacred life of home we do not speak of our loyalty and
devotion, but act on them as principles so certain as to need no
expression, so it was here. The day was a very happy one. Every
one went about her work with a new impulse of earnestness, a new
assurance of peaceful continuity. For the rest, the future will
speak, and the past is witness that the future will be good.”</p>

<p class='c005'>On Prize Day, that last day of the old which was
the first day of the new era, Lady Frederick Cavendish
in her address dwelt especially on the faith and
sympathy of the Founder as the secret of the success
of her schools, finding here, as everywhere, the true
source of all great and lasting work in the faith that
uplifts and the love that unites.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then from the bright past the speaker looked
beyond the darkly shadowed present to a future full of
hope in the work to come. None present on that day
will forget the inspiration of the closing words of this
address—words doubly strong as quoted by one who
had come through a great darkness into the light: one
who will always stand out as witness that a heart
emptied of joy may yet become a full channel of
blessing—</p>
